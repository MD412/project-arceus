# Context Handoff - October 28, 2025 @ 2:00 AM

Branch: `main`
Status: Phase 5a deployed and tested; duplicate scan bug fixed

---

## Session Accomplishments

### Phase 5a: Training Feedback Infrastructure (Deployed)

**What Was Built:**
1. **Database migration** - `training_feedback` table with 15 columns, 7 indexes, 3 RLS policies
2. **Worker logging** - Every card identification logged to training_feedback
3. **Correction API** - Updates feedback table when users correct cards
4. **Documentation system** - SESSION_BOOTSTRAP, CODEX_STARTER_PROMPT for context handoffs

**Deployment:**
- Migration applied successfully ✅
- Worker deployed with logging integration ✅
- API updates deployed ✅
- Verified schema, indexes, RLS policies ✅

**Testing Status:**
- Table structure verified
- No data yet (awaiting next scan upload to test end-to-end)
- Correction API untested (needs manual card correction)

### Bug Investigation & Fix: Duplicate Scan Uploads

**Problem Discovered:**
- Single upload created 2 scan records (10 seconds apart)
- Both scans shared same storage_path
- Only 1 job created, causing confusion
- Training_feedback had duplicate logging code (fixed)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Frontend double-submission (race condition or double-click)
- No unique constraint on `scans.storage_path`
- RPC `enqueue_scan_job` not idempotent

**Fixes Deployed:**
1. **Database:** Added unique index on `storage_path` + idempotent RPC
2. **Frontend:** Added `mutation.isPending` check in ScanUploadForm
3. **Worker:** Removed duplicate logging code (kept clean refactored version)
4. **Cleanup:** Deleted duplicate scan records

## Current State

### What's Working
- Training feedback infrastructure deployed
- Database constraints prevent duplicate scans
- Frontend prevents double-submission
- Worker logs all identifications (awaiting first post-deploy scan)
- Correction API ready to update feedback

### What's Not Yet Tested
- End-to-end training feedback flow (no scans uploaded since deployment)
- Correction API feedback updates (needs manual test)
- Duplicate prevention in production (needs retry test)

### Known Issues
- None currently blocking

---

## Next Session Entry Points

### Immediate: Verify Phase 5a
1. **Upload test scan** - Verify training_feedback rows created
2. **Check data:** `SELECT * FROM training_feedback ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10`
3. **Test correction** - Correct a card via UI, verify feedback updated
4. **Verify duplicates blocked** - Try uploading same file twice

### Phase 5b: Auto-Learning (Next Major Feature)
1. **Background job:** Process pending corrections from training_feedback
2. **High-confidence filter:** Auto-add crops with good scores as templates
3. **Template insertion:** Add to `card_templates` with source='user_correction'
4. **Prototype rebuild:** Incremental updates to card_gallery embeddings

### Phase 5c: Dashboard (Future)
1. **Confusion matrix:** Most common misidentifications
2. **Training queue:** Review and manage corrections
3. **Quality analytics:** Blur/glare/angle tracking
4. **Accuracy metrics:** Over-time trends, UNKNOWN rate monitoring

## Key Insights

### "Seemed Too Easy" Was Right
- Initial deployment had duplicate logging bug (would've crashed)
- Investigation revealed duplicate scan upload vulnerability
- Both fixed before hitting production users

### Documentation as Infrastructure
- Created self-bootstrapping context system
- Future sessions can cold-start in ~30 seconds
- `SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md` explains itself

### Database Design Patterns
- Views over tables (`scan_uploads` → `scans`)
- Auto-updatable views simplified legacy compatibility
- Unique constraints + idempotent RPCs = duplicate prevention

### Worker Reliability
- Non-blocking logging (don't fail jobs on feedback errors)
- Refactored helper functions better than inline code
- Duplicate code detection caught in review

## Testing Checklist (Next Session)

- [ ] Upload scan → Check training_feedback populated
- [ ] Verify predicted_card_id, score, method logged correctly
- [ ] Correct a card → Verify corrected_card_id updated
- [ ] Query pending corrections: `WHERE corrected_card_id IS NOT NULL`
- [ ] Try duplicate upload → Should be rejected by unique constraint
- [ ] Check RPC idempotency → Second call with same path = no-op

---

## Database Schema Reference

```sql
-- Phase 5a Tables
training_feedback (
  id, created_at, scan_id, detection_id, crop_storage_path,
  predicted_card_id, prediction_score, prediction_method,
  corrected_card_id, corrected_by, corrected_at,
  quality_issues JSONB, user_notes, training_status, processed_at
)

-- Key Constraints
- FK: scan_id → scans(id) CASCADE
- FK: detection_id → card_detections(id) CASCADE
- FK: corrected_by → auth.users(id) SET NULL
- Index: storage_path (unique, prevents duplicates)
- Index: training_status (filtered WHERE pending)
```
