# Context Handoff - October 28, 2025 @ 6:00 PM

Branch: `main`  
Status: Worker fix deployed, awaiting Render redeploy to test detections

## Session Accomplishments

### 🔐 Security Fix
- **Git Guardian Alert:** `.cursor/mcp.json` was leaking API tokens to public repo
- Added `.cursor/` to `.gitignore`
- User rotated tokens before fix

### 🐛 Frontend Fixes

**1. Scan Titles**
- Changed from "Untitled Scan" to show full UUID
- Modified `services/jobs.ts` generateScanTitle()

**2. Card Count Display**
- Fixed `scan_uploads` view showing hardcoded `total_cards_detected: 0`
- Created SECURITY DEFINER function `count_scan_detections()` to bypass RLS
- View now shows actual detection counts

**3. Query Optimization**
- Simplified `getJobs()` to use `scan_uploads` view directly
- Removed manual detection counting (was hitting RLS issues)

### 🗄️ Database Cleanup

**Root Cause Discovery:**
- User reported: "Detections worked Oct 27, now showing 0"
- Investigation revealed: Phase 5a migration deleted duplicate scans
- CASCADE deleted all October detections (76 rows total)
- **User was RIGHT** - worker was always working, data got deleted by migration

**Legacy System Removed:**
- Deleted `scan_images` table (21 rows, old batch system)
- Deleted `scan_batches` table (21 rows, old batch system)
- Deleted `user_card_instances` table (0 rows, unused)
- Removed `image_id` column from `card_detections`
- Cleaned 76 orphaned detections + 133 user_cards entries

**Active System:**
- `scans` → single scan records (60 rows)
- `card_detections` → links via `scan_id` only
- `job_queue` → job processing (50 rows)

### 🔧 Worker Fix

**Issue:** Duplicate constraint violation
- Frontend `enqueue_scan_job` creates scan record
- Worker tried to INSERT again → hit unique constraint
- Fix: Changed worker to use UPSERT instead of INSERT

**Local Testing Setup:**
- Created `run_worker.ps1` for local development
- Uses existing `.venv-gpu` environment
- Runs against production DB (no config changes needed)

## Files Modified

### Migrations
- `20251028010000_fix_scan_uploads_view.sql` - Fixed hardcoded detection count
- `20251028020000_fix_scan_uploads_view_rls.sql` - Added SECURITY DEFINER function
- `20251028030000_cleanup_legacy_batch_system.sql` - Deleted legacy data
- `20251028040000_drop_legacy_tables.sql` - Dropped unused tables

### Code Changes
- `.gitignore` - Added `.cursor/` directory
- `services/jobs.ts` - Simplified to use view directly, fixed titles
- `worker/worker.py` - Changed INSERT to UPSERT for scan records
- `run_worker.ps1` - Created local worker test script

## Current State

### What's Working
- ✅ Frontend loads scans correctly
- ✅ Scan titles show UUIDs
- ✅ Card counts display properly (0 for now, since detections cleared)
- ✅ Database cleaned of confusing legacy tables
- ✅ Worker fix pushed to Render

### What's Deploying
- 🔄 Render worker redeployment in progress (upsert fix)

### What's Not Yet Tested
- ⏳ Fresh scan upload after Render deployment
- ⏳ Worker creating detections in `card_detections` table
- ⏳ Training feedback logging (Phase 5a)

---

## Known Issues

### Stuck Scans
- 5 scans stuck in "processing" status from failed jobs
- Jobs marked as "failed" due to duplicate constraint error
- Will auto-resolve once new scans process successfully

### Worker Race Condition
- Local worker + Render worker both poll same queue
- Render worker currently failing due to old code
- Will resolve when Render deployment completes

---

## Next Session Entry Points

### Immediate: Test Worker Fix
1. Wait for Render deployment to complete (~5-10 min)
2. Upload a fresh test scan via UI
3. Verify detections appear in:
   - `card_detections` table
   - `training_feedback` table
   - Frontend scan detail page

**SQL to check:**
```sql
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.created_at,
  COUNT(cd.id) as detections
FROM scans s
LEFT JOIN card_detections cd ON cd.scan_id = s.id
WHERE s.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY s.id, s.created_at
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;
```

### If Still Broken
1. Check Render logs for worker errors
2. Test with local worker: `./run_worker.ps1`
3. Verify RPC `enqueue_scan_job` is creating jobs correctly

### Phase 5b: Auto-Learning (Next Feature)
- Background job to process pending corrections
- Auto-add high-confidence crops as templates
- Incremental prototype rebuild

## Key Insights

### "It Was Working 2 Days Ago"
- User's instinct was correct - worker never broke
- Phase 5a duplicate cleanup migration (Oct 27) deleted scans
- ON DELETE CASCADE wiped October detections
- Lesson: Always check migration side effects on FKs

### Database Archaeology
- Found dual systems: `scans` (current) vs `scan_images` (legacy)
- 76 detections were linked to old system via `image_id`
- Recent scans (Sept-Oct) in new system but zero detections
- Cleaning confusion fixed future debugging

### Worker Design Pattern
- Worker is stateless job processor
- Polls production DB from anywhere (local or Render)
- No code changes needed to test locally
- Just run `./run_worker.ps1` with production credentials

## Git Commits This Session

1. `88291de8` - chore: add .cursor/ to .gitignore (security)
2. `6d988ac8` - fix: clean up legacy batch system tables
3. `4ede6af1` - fix: worker upsert scan instead of insert
4. `ffa9192c` - session: fix scan detection display, clean legacy tables

## Testing Checklist (Next Session)

- [ ] Render deployment completed successfully
- [ ] Upload fresh scan → creates job
- [ ] Worker picks up job → processes scan
- [ ] YOLO detects cards → creates bounding boxes
- [ ] CLIP identifies cards → saves to `card_detections`
- [ ] Training feedback logged → saves to `training_feedback`
- [ ] User cards created → saves to `user_cards`
- [ ] Summary image uploaded → scan status = "ready"
- [ ] Frontend displays cards in scan detail page
- [ ] Card count shows > 0 in scans table

Status: **Awaiting Render deployment** (fix pushed, need fresh scan test)
