# Context Handoff - October 14, 2025 (11:15 PM, Late Session)

## üìç Where We Are
- Worker live on Render with higher RAM plan
- Logs accessible via Render MCP; service polling with no pending jobs
- Supabase MCP config needs single-source `.cursor/mcp.json` to avoid token conflicts

---

## ‚úÖ What Got Done (Late Session)
- Diagnosed Render OOM; upgraded service plan and verified stable startup
- Implemented `/start-session` and `/end-session` slash commands
- Cleaned working-memory docs and updated `active_context.md`
- Investigated missing jobs: identified RPC signature drift risk; suggested direct requeue path
- Aligned MCP configs; guided to keep Supabase MCP only in workspace config and reload

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Supabase MCP token not loading in one Cursor window due to dual mcp.json; needs reload
- Jobs not appearing: API may call old `enqueue_scan_job(p_scan_id, p_user_id, p_storage_path)` while DB has 2-arg variant

---

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next
1. Reload MCP servers and run:
   - `select * from job_queue order by created_at desc limit 20;`
   - `select * from scan_uploads order by created_at desc limit 20;`
   - `select pg_get_functiondef('public.enqueue_scan_job'::regproc);`
2. If 2-arg function is present, either:
   - update API to use 2-arg RPC, or
   - restore 3-arg RPC, or
   - use `POST /api/scans/{id}/retry` to enqueue directly
3. Enqueue a test job and watch Render logs for dequeue ‚Üí detect ‚Üí identify ‚Üí complete

## üîó Modified/Referenced
- `.cursor/commands/start-session.md`
- `.cursor/commands/end-session.md`
- `docs/working-memory/active_context.md`
- `.cursor/mcp.json` (workspace) vs `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (user)
