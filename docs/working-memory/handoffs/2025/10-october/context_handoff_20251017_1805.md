### Fixed Card Detail Modal Image Clipping

**Problem:** Card images in CardDetailModal were getting cut off (top/bottom clipped), not fitting within modal boundaries. User provided screenshot showing Vileplume card with visible clipping.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Grid layout with `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` caused improper height distribution
- Conflicting `height: 100%` on `.card-detail-modal__layout` 
- Grid row height was determined by content, not available container space
- Image sizing with `height: 100%` created circular dependency

**Solution:**
Changed from CSS Grid to Flexbox layout:
- Layout: `display: flex; flex-direction: row` instead of `display: grid`
- Both columns: `flex: 1` for equal distribution
- Image container: flex centering instead of grid `place-items`
- Image: `height: 100%; max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%`
- Reduced padding from `space-600` to `space-300` for more vertical space

**Result:**
‚úÖ Card images now display completely from top to bottom  
‚úÖ Proper aspect ratio maintained  
‚úÖ No clipping or overflow  
‚úÖ Images fill available space appropriately

## üìÅ Files Modified

**CSS:**
- `app/styles/card-detail-modal.css` - Complete layout refactor

### Key Changes in card-detail-modal.css:

**Layout (lines 25-33):**
```css
/* Before: Grid */
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
height: 100%; /* ‚Üê Caused overflow */

/* After: Flexbox */
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
padding: var(--sds-size-space-300); /* Reduced */
```

**Image Container (lines 36-45):**
```css
/* Before: Grid placement */
display: grid;
place-items: center;

/* After: Flex centering */
display: flex;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
flex: 1;
```

**Details Panel (lines 58-66):**
```css
/* Added */
flex: 1;
min-height: 0;
overflow-y: auto;
```

## üêõ Known Issues

**None from this session**

Previous issues unrelated to this work:
- Card search performance monitoring (from Oct 17 earlier)
- Some cards may have empty `image_urls` in database

---

## üîç What's Next

### Immediate
1. **Test with various card types** - Verify fix works with landscape cards, different aspect ratios
2. **Test mobile responsiveness** - Check modal on small screens
3. **Monitor for edge cases** - Extra tall cards, missing images

### Future Enhancements
- Add keyboard shortcuts for modal navigation
- Improve modal animations
- Add metadata display (artist, rarity, set info)
- Real market pricing integration

## üéì Technical Notes

### Why Flexbox Fixed It

**Grid Problem:**
- Grid rows auto-size based on content by default
- `grid-template-rows: 1fr` tried to use remaining space but conflicted with content sizing
- Image with `height: 100%` + container with `height: 100%` = circular dependency

**Flexbox Solution:**
- `flex: 1` distributes available space after accounting for header/footer
- Flex items with `min-height: 0` allow proper shrinking
- Image respects both width AND height constraints simultaneously
- No circular dependencies

### Flexbox Min-Height Gotcha

Key to making this work: `min-height: 0` on flex children allows them to shrink below content size. Without it, flex items refuse to shrink below their content's natural height.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for testing  
**Next session:** Test edge cases, consider other modal improvements
