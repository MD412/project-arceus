# Context Handoff - October 16, 2025 @ 7:05 PM

**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** UI improvements complete - collection page header refactored, card size slider disabled for future

---

## 🎯 Where We Left Off

Completed major UI cleanup on the collection page focusing on header consolidation, sticky positioning, and table view improvements. Explored adding a dynamic card size slider feature but disabled it after successful implementation since it needs fine-tuning to match the original carefully-tuned responsive breakpoints.

## 🏆 Session Accomplishments

### Collection Page Header Refactoring
- ✅ Changed sticky header top position from `48px` to `0px` (flush with page top)
- ✅ Merged `CollectionFilters` directly into header (removed separate floating-filters wrapper)
- ✅ Created clean three-column layout: Title | Stats | Filters
- ✅ Changed page title from `<h1>` to `<h5>` for more compact sizing (26px → 18px)
- ✅ Removed "Welcome back, email" text for cleaner UI
- ✅ Set header padding to `0px` top/bottom (was `12px` all sides)
- ✅ Removed double padding issue: eliminated `12px` padding from `.card-grid`, kept it only on `.cards-section`
- ✅ Set `.cards-section` padding to uniform `12px` on all sides

### Table View Polish
- ✅ Fixed table scroll container hierarchy to enable sticky header within table
- ✅ Made `.collection-page` and `.scroll-wrapper` flex containers
- ✅ Made `.cards-section--table` its own scroll container with `overflow: hidden`
- ✅ Table header now properly sticks to top of table's scroll area (not page scroll)
- ✅ Removed bottom margin from `.cards-section` (`margin-bottom: 0px`)

### Card Size Slider Feature (Future Feature)
- ✅ Implemented floating bottom-right slider with localStorage persistence
- ✅ Created dynamic grid using `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(var(--card-min-width), 1fr))`
- ✅ Slider range: 120px - 300px with 20px steps
- ✅ Glassmorphism styling matching design system
- ✅ **Disabled and documented** - needs fine-tuning to match original breakpoints
- ✅ Created `docs/future-features/card-size-slider.md` with full implementation guide

## 🔍 What's Next

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Modal Consistency** - User mentioned comparing home page vs scans modal but got tired before specifying what to fix
   - Home page modal: Shows card + details + collection info + footer buttons
   - Scans modal: Shows AI Match + Original Crop + Replace button
   - Both use same base `Modal` component with different configurations
   - May need alignment/spacing adjustments or layout consistency

2. **Card Size Slider (Optional)** - If user wants to re-enable:
   - Uncomment code in `app/(app)/page.tsx` (marked with `// FUTURE FEATURE`)
   - Update grid CSS in `app/styles/trading-card.css` to use dynamic sizing
   - See `docs/future-features/card-size-slider.md` for complete instructions
   - Consider adding min/max constraints per viewport breakpoint
   - Add preset sizes (S/M/L/XL) instead of continuous slider

3. **Render Worker Deploy** - Check if worker redeploy succeeded
   - If healthy: Continue with any remaining UI polish
   - If failed: Debug env sanitization or runtime issues

### Deferred
- Manual DevTools responsive testing
- Live worker validation
- Trace ID propagation
- Search component consolidation
- Performance profiling

## 🎨 UI State Summary

**Collection Page Header:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ My Collection  │  Collected: X • Qty: Y • Sets: Z  │ [Search][Filters][Grid/Table] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  (h5, 18px)         (stats, middle)                    (filters, right)
```

**Table View:**
- Sticky header works within table scroll container
- Edge-to-edge layout (no side padding when in table mode)
- Header sticks at `top: 0` of `.table-wrapper` scroll area

**Grid View:**
- Original responsive breakpoints restored
- Uniform 12px padding around grid
- 2-7 columns based on viewport width (carefully tuned by user)

## 💡 Notes for Next Session

- User got tired before specifying modal fixes - ask what specifically needs adjustment
- Card size slider is fully implemented and ready to re-enable if desired
- All original responsive breakpoints preserved and working
- Header is now more compact and cleaner (removed welcome message, smaller title)
