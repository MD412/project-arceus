# Context Handoff - October 26, 2025 @ 1:00 AM

Branch: `main`
Status: Retrieval v2 deployed with worker integration; Phase 5 roadmap defined

---

## Session Accomplishments

### Fixed Worker Integration with Retrieval v2
- **Problem:** Worker was hardcoded to use legacy CLIP, ignoring `RETRIEVAL_IMPL=v2` setting
- **Solution:** Updated `worker.py` to conditionally use `identify_v2()` when env var set
- Fixed import paths in `retrieval_v2.py` for worker directory structure
- Pushed fix to trigger Render deployment

### Solved Domain Gap with User's Actual Scan
- **Discovery:** Test fixture ≠ user's actual Greavard scan
- Found 8 instances of user's Greavard misidentified as Great Tusk ex (svp-72)
- Downloaded actual user crop from scan history
- Added user's real scan as template for sv3-92
- **Result:** Perfect match! Template similarity = 1.0, fused score = 0.9592

### Defined Phase 5: Simplified Learning Infrastructure
- User requested "super stupid simple" central training table
- Designed `training_feedback` table as single source of truth
- One place to track: crops, predictions, corrections, training status
- Simplified from original distributed Phase 5 plan

## Files Modified/Created

### Worker Integration
- `worker/worker.py` - Added retrieval v2 conditional logic
- `worker/retrieval_v2.py` - Fixed import paths

### Scripts Added
- `scripts/check_recent_scans.py` - Examine scan history
- `scripts/find_great_tusk.py` - Find misidentified Greavard scans
- `scripts/add_user_greavard_template.py` - Add user's actual scan as template
- `scripts/test_user_greavard.py` - Verify fix worked
- `scripts/debug_scan.py` - Debug retrieval issues
- `scripts/test_worker_v2.py` - Test worker v2 integration

### Database Changes
- Added user's Greavard scan as template (source='user_scan')
- Rebuilt sv3-92 prototype to include new template

### Key Files
- `great_tusk_crop.jpg` - User's actual Greavard scan (downloaded from storage)

## Current State

### What's Working
- Retrieval v2 live in production with `RETRIEVAL_IMPL=v2`
- User's Greavard scan identifies correctly (0.9592 score)
- Clean scan templates provide perfect matches (1.0 similarity)

### What's Not
- Only 4 cards have real scan templates (3 test + 1 user)
- Other 15,500 cards still have domain gap
- No automatic learning from corrections yet

### Known Issues
- Statement timeout (57014) on large TopK queries
- Need migration for `training_feedback` table
- Dashboard views not implemented

---

## Phase 5 Roadmap

### 5a: Foundation (Next Session)
- Create `training_feedback` table migration
- Wire up logging on every identification
- Add correction mechanism to UI

### 5b: Auto-Learning
- Background job to process pending feedback
- Auto-add high-confidence as templates
- Rebuild prototypes incrementally

### 5c: Dashboard
- Build confusion matrix view
- Training queue management
- Quality issue tracking

### 5d: Fine-tuning (Future)
- Export training batches
- Fine-tune ViT model
- Version tracking

## Next Session Entry Points

1. **Create migration:** `supabase/migrations/xxx_training_feedback_table.sql`
2. **Update worker:** Log to `training_feedback` on every identification
3. **Add UI:** Correction mechanism in scan review interface
4. **Test loop:** Scan → Correct → Verify template added

## Key Insights

- **Domain gap is real:** Official art ≠ real scans (0.65 vs 0.95+ similarity)
- **Clean scans are magic:** Template match = 1.0 dominates fusion
- **User's data is gold:** Their actual scans are the best training data
- **Simple > Complex:** One table beats distributed system

Status: Ready for Phase 5a implementation
