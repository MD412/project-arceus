# Context Handoff - October 13, 2025 (6:30 PM)

## 📍 Where We Are

**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** Modified files ready to commit  
**Focus:** Fixed scan detail page layout and correction modal UX

---

## ✅ What Got Done

### Scan Detail Page Layout Fixes
- ✅ Fixed scrolling issues - made breadcrumbs/actions sticky, content scrollable
- ✅ Removed inner padding from `app-content` div
- ✅ Refactored inline styles to CSS modules (`page.module.css`)
- ✅ Adjusted header to 8px vertical padding with darker teal background
- ✅ Fixed breadcrumb/action horizontal justification

### Breadcrumb Component Improvements  
- ✅ Links turn bold on hover (using `u-text-link` utility class)
- ✅ Fixed cursor behavior (pointer for links, default for current page)
- ✅ Vertically centered arrow separators
- ✅ Consistent font styling between links and current page text

### Correction Modal UX Overhaul
- ✅ Implemented "EZ mode" Replace Card flow
  - Search panel swaps with AI Match (left)
  - Original scan crop stays visible (right)
- ✅ Fixed modal jarring resize - set to 75vh/75vw fixed dimensions
- ✅ Standardized modal CSS classes to kebab-case
- ✅ Fixed duplicate headers between Modal.tsx and CorrectionModal.tsx
- ✅ Added "AI Match" and "Original Scan Crop" labels

### Modal Responsiveness Battle 🥊
- ✅ Fixed images creating scrollbars - now shrink to fit
- ✅ Implemented 2x2 grid layout for balanced columns
- ✅ Fixed AI Match image getting cut off
- ✅ Fixed unequal column sizing issues
- ✅ Multiple iterations on flexbox/grid logic
- ✅ Images now properly constrained with `object-fit: contain`
- ✅ Override Next.js Image inline styles with `!important`

### Additional Improvements
- ✅ Added 8px gap between DetectionTile elements
- ✅ Replaced "Market Value" with "Scan Provenance" in modal
- ✅ Documented ML feedback loop architecture (`docs/architecture/ml-feedback-loop.md`)
- ✅ Added Git commit batching rule to prevent over-committing

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Added Rule 2: Session Context Priority
- ✅ Added Rule 3: Git Commit Best Practices  
- ✅ Archived NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF.md
- ✅ Updated docs to reference active_context.md as single source of truth

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Modal Complexity Problem
The 2x2 grid layout for CorrectionModal is now applied globally to all modals using `.modal-card-info`, which **breaks the home page collection modal**. 

**Recommended Fix (Next Session):**
Split into two separate components:
- `Modal.tsx` - Keep for general collection/card viewing
- `CorrectionModal.tsx` - Make fully self-contained with own modal wrapper

This provides:
- Clear separation of concerns
- No CSS conflicts between use cases
- Each modal can evolve independently
- Easier long-term maintenance

---

## 🚀 What's Next

1. **Fix Modal Conflict** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Split Modal and CorrectionModal into separate components
   - Test both collection and correction modals work correctly

2. **Continue from Oct 10 Handoff**
   - Review remaining items from previous session
   - Check if any deferred tasks are now ready

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test the scan detail page thoroughly
   - Verify correction modal works with real data

## 📝 Session Notes

- User working from Windows today, switching to MacBook next session
- Significant time spent on modal responsiveness (flexbox/grid iterations)
- Good decision to batch commits at session end rather than after each change
- Modal complexity needs architectural solution rather than CSS hacks
