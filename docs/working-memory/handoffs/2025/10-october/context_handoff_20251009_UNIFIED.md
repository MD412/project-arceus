# Context Handoff - October 9, 2025 (UNIFIED)

**Branch:** `chore/system-mri-001`  
**Total Duration:** ~7.5 hours (2 sessions)  
**Status:** ✅ System documented + Worker validated + UI polished  
**Current State:** 15 uncommitted files, ready for next phase

---

## 📅 Session Timeline

### Session 1: System MRI (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
- System architecture mapped (SYSTEM_MAP.md - 463 lines)
- Worker validated with improved logging (22 historical runs confirmed)
- Review UI cleaned (removed duplicates, added TypeScript types)
- Living memory system created
- Command automation added (/start, /end, /checkpoint)

### Session 2: UI Polish (4:00 PM - 5:30 PM)
- Collection page: sticky headers + glassmorphism effects
- Navigation simplified (removed "Scan History" page)
- Table view: edge-to-edge layout with sticky header
- Filter controls: uniform height + transparency theme

---

## 🎯 Current Top Priorities

### 🔴 1. Fix user_cards Bug (HIGH PRIORITY - BLOCKING)
**Problem:** All 22 historical worker runs show `"user_cards_created": 0`

**Why it matters:** Users can detect cards successfully but can't build their collection. Cards are identified but never added to `user_cards` table.

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- Worker gets text IDs from CLIP (e.g., "sv8pt5-160")
- `user_cards.card_id` requires UUIDs
- Bridge function `resolve_card_uuid()` likely returns None
- Without UUID, user_cards creation is skipped

**Investigation Path:**
```sql
-- 1. Check card_keys table population
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card_keys;
SELECT * FROM card_keys LIMIT 5;

-- 2. Test specific external ID
SELECT * FROM card_keys WHERE external_id = 'sv8pt5-160';

-- 3. Check if card exists
SELECT id, name FROM cards WHERE id IN (
  SELECT card_id FROM card_keys WHERE external_id = 'sv8pt5-160'
);
```

**Files to Debug:**
- `worker/worker.py` lines 83-160 (resolve_card_uuid function)
- `worker/worker.py` lines 410-430 (user_cards creation logic)
- `docs/database-schema.md` (card_keys table structure)

**Fix Options:**
- Option A: Backfill card_keys from card_embeddings
- Option B: Make worker auto-create mappings on-the-fly
- Test: Upload scan → verify user_cards row created

---

### 🟡 2. Test Responsive Behavior (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Recent UI changes need validation across viewports:

**Test Plan:**
1. Open collection page in Chrome DevTools responsive mode
2. Test viewports: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop)
3. Check sticky header behavior on scroll
4. Verify glassmorphism effects render correctly
5. Test filter controls sizing and alignment
6. Validate table view edge-to-edge layout

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Sticky header stays in place on mobile
- ✅ Filter controls remain usable and uniform height
- ✅ Table view scrolls properly on small screens
- ✅ No horizontal overflow issues
- ✅ Glass effects perform well (no lag)

## 🗃️ Database Schema (Critical for Bug Fix)

### The UUID Mapping Problem
```
card_embeddings.card_id (text: "sv8pt5-160")
    ↓ [NEEDS BRIDGE]
card_keys (mapping table)
    ↓
cards.id (uuid: "a1b2c3d4-...")
    ↓
user_cards.card_id (requires uuid)
```

### Key Tables

#### `card_embeddings` (19k+ rows)
```sql
card_id: text              -- External ID (e.g., "sv8pt5-160")
embedding: vector(512)     -- CLIP embedding
model_version: text
image_url: text
```

#### `card_keys` (mapping table - CHECK IF POPULATED!)
```sql
source: text               -- e.g., "pokemon_tcg_api"
external_id: text          -- e.g., "sv8pt5-160"
card_id: uuid              -- references cards.id
UNIQUE (source, external_id)
```

#### `cards` (card metadata)
```sql
id: uuid (primary key)     -- Internal UUID
name: text
set_name: text
collector_number: text
image_url: text
```

#### `user_cards` (user collection - FAILING HERE)
```sql
id: uuid (primary key)
user_id: uuid
card_id: uuid              -- Requires UUID, NOT external_id!
detection_id: uuid
quantity: integer
UNIQUE (user_id, card_id)
```

#### `card_detections` (worker output)
```sql
id: uuid (primary key)
scan_id: uuid
card_index: integer
card_id: text              -- External ID from CLIP
card_name: text
cropped_image_path: text
identification_confidence: float
```

**THE PROBLEM:** Worker gets text IDs from CLIP, but user_cards needs UUIDs. The `resolve_card_uuid()` bridge is broken.

---

## 🏗️ Worker Architecture

### Processing Pipeline
```
1. Dequeue job from job_queue
2. Download image from Supabase Storage (scans bucket)
3. YOLO detection → find card bounding boxes
4. Crop detected cards
5. CLIP batch identification → match to card_embeddings (returns external IDs)
6. resolve_card_uuid(external_id) → lookup in card_keys → get UUID [FAILING]
7. Create card_detections records (with external text ID) [OK]
8. Create user_cards records (with UUID) [SKIPPED - NO UUID]
9. Generate summary image
10. Upload to Storage + update DB
```

### Key Worker Functions
```python
# worker/worker.py

def resolve_card_uuid(supabase_client, source: str, external_card_id: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Resolve external text card ID (e.g., sv8pt5-160) to internal cards.id (UUID).
    
    Steps:
    1) Try card_keys direct mapping
    2) Try cards table direct lookup
    3) Create card from card_embeddings if exists
    
    Returns: UUID string or None
    """
    # Lines 83-160 - INVESTIGATE THIS LOGIC

def run_normalized_pipeline(...):
    # Lines 410-430 - user_cards creation
    
    resolved_uuid = resolve_card_uuid(...)  # <-- Returns None?
    
    if resolved_uuid:  # <-- Never truthy?
        user_card_data = {
            "user_id": user_id,
            "detection_id": detection_id,
            "card_id": resolved_uuid,  # Needs UUID
            ...
        }
        supabase_client.from_("user_cards").upsert(user_card_data, ...)
```

---

## 🧪 Test Data & Evidence

### Worker Output Logs (22 files)
Location: `worker/output/*.json`

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "scan_id": "f45d1d2b-3051-4c39-8f13-7d9339f923f2",
  "total_detections": 10,
  "user_cards_created": 0,  // <-- BUG: Should be > 0
  "detection_records": ["uuid1", "uuid2", ...]
}
```

All 22 historical runs show same pattern: detections created, but user_cards = 0.

### Test Images
Location: `test-raw_scan_images/` (6 images ready for upload)

### Debugging SQL Queries
```sql
-- Check card_keys
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card_keys;

-- Check recent detections
SELECT card_id, card_name FROM card_detections 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Test UUID resolution for known card
SELECT * FROM card_keys WHERE external_id = 'sv8pt5-160';

-- Check user_cards
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_cards;
SELECT * FROM user_cards WHERE user_id = '<test-user-id>';

-- Join to see the gap
SELECT 
  cd.card_id as external_id,
  cd.card_name,
  ck.card_id as resolved_uuid,
  c.name as card_name_from_cards
FROM card_detections cd
LEFT JOIN card_keys ck ON ck.external_id = cd.card_id
LEFT JOIN cards c ON c.id = ck.card_id
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🎨 UI Changes (Session 2)

### Navigation Cleanup
- ✅ Deleted `/scans/completed` page (redundant scan history)
- ✅ Updated `components/Navigation.tsx`:
  - Removed "Scan History" link
  - Renamed "Processing Scans" → "Scans"
  - Flattened sidebar: moved "Scans" to same level as "Collection"
- ✅ Updated page title in `app/(app)/scans/page.tsx`

### Collection Page Header (`app/(app)/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Made header sticky with glassmorphism effect:
  - `position: sticky`, `top: 0`, `z-index: 20`
  - Background: `rgba(27, 62, 66, 0.85)` (semi-transparent darker teal)
  - `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` for glass effect
  - Border: `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
  - Shadow: `0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`
- ✅ Reduced padding to 12px all sides
- ✅ Removed "Drag Enabled/Disabled" button
- ✅ Right-justified stats line
- ✅ Created `.sticky-header-group` wrapper

### Search/Filter Bar (`components/ui/CollectionFilters.*`)
- ✅ Made sticky with glassmorphism effect
- ✅ Updated colors for transparency theme
- ✅ Made ALL toolbar controls fill 100% height:
  - Filter buttons: `height: 100%`
  - Dropdowns: `height: 100%`
  - View toggle: `align-self: stretch`
- ✅ Reduced icon sizes to 12px
- ✅ Reduced gap between filters and table to 8px

### Table View
- ✅ Removed left-right padding (edge-to-edge layout)
- ✅ Table header: `position: sticky; top: 0`
- ✅ Removed side borders and border-radius
- ✅ `.table-wrapper` is scroll container

### Layout Refactoring
- ✅ Renamed `.container` → `.collection-page` (avoid global conflicts)
- ✅ Fixed container structure for proper scroll
- ✅ Added `/` to `shouldHaveNoPadding` in layout
- ✅ Updated `app/styles/navigation.css`:
  - `.main-content-area`: `overflow: hidden`
  - `.app-content`: `min-height: 0`, `overflow: hidden`

### Glassmorphism Pattern
```css
background: rgba(27, 62, 66, 0.85);
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
```

## 🛠️ Git Patterns (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS use `--no-pager` flag:**
```bash
git --no-pager status
git --no-pager log --oneline -5
git --no-pager diff --stat
git --no-pager add <files>
git --no-pager commit -m "message"
```

**Why:** Git's pager blocks terminal indefinitely waiting for keyboard input. This caused multiple terminal hangs during Session 1.

---

## ✅ What's Already Done (Don't Redo)

### Session 1 (System MRI)
- ✅ Worker has env validation and stage-by-stage logging
- ✅ Worker validated with 22 historical successful runs
- ✅ Review UI cleanup complete (duplicates removed)
- ✅ ScanReviewShell has TypeScript types + JSDoc
- ✅ System architecture fully documented (SYSTEM_MAP.md - 463 lines)
- ✅ Living memory system created
- ✅ Command automation: /start, /end, /checkpoint

### Session 2 (UI Polish)
- ✅ Collection page sticky headers + glassmorphism
- ✅ Navigation simplified (removed "Scan History")
- ✅ Filter controls: uniform height + transparency theme
- ✅ Table view: edge-to-edge layout with sticky header
- ✅ Layout overflow issues resolved

---

## 🚫 Explicitly Deferred (Don't Touch)

- ❌ Trace ID propagation (premature optimization)
- ❌ Search component consolidation (not on critical path)
- ❌ Model version tracking (nice-to-have)
- ❌ Performance profiling (optimize after core features work)
- ❌ Observability infrastructure (future work)

**Focus:** Fix user_cards bug first, then test responsiveness. Everything else waits.

---

## 🎯 Next Session Goals (Prioritized)

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Fix user_cards creation bug**
   - Investigate card_keys table population
   - Debug resolve_card_uuid() function
   - Test end-to-end: scan → collection
   - Success: `user_cards_created > 0` in output log

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
2. **Responsive testing**
   - Validate UI changes across viewports
   - Fix any mobile/tablet issues
   - Test glassmorphism performance

3. **Commit UI polish changes**
   - Clean commit message
   - Stage 15 modified files
   - Update SYSTEM_MAP.md

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY
4. **Add safety constraint**
   - Unique constraint on detections (scan_id, card_index)
   - Prevent duplicate detections on retry

5. **Live E2E test**
   - Run worker with new logging
   - Upload test scan
   - Verify all stages work

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical
1. **Git pager issue:** Always use `--no-pager` (prevents terminal hangs)
2. **CSS conflicts:** Global `.container` class conflicted with page-specific containers
3. **Sticky positioning:** Requires careful attention to parent `overflow` properties
4. **Height filling:** Use `height: 100%` on children, let parent size naturally
5. **Historical evidence:** 22 logs validated worker without needing live test

### Process
1. **Living memory:** Timestamped context = zero context loss
2. **Command patterns:** /start, /end automate session management
3. **Documentation compounds:** Each session builds on the last
4. **Iterative refinement:** Small changes + user feedback > big refactors
