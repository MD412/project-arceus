# Context Handoff - October 29, 2025 @ 3:00 PM

Branch: `main`  
Status: ‚úÖ Phase 5b deployed, Worker fixed, Render rebuilding

## Session Accomplishments

### üè≠ Phase 5b: Auto-Learning System (COMPLETE!)

**Built the competitive moat - system that learns from user corrections:**

**Database Tables (Deployed):**
- ‚úÖ `card_confusion` - Tracks which cards confuse the model
- ‚úÖ `template_metadata` - Manages template quality & caps
- ‚úÖ Helper functions: `count_user_templates()`, `get_lowest_quality_template()`

**Processing Pipeline:**
- ‚úÖ `scripts/process_training_feedback.py` - Full 7-step factory:
  1. Harvest corrections from `training_feedback`
  2. Filter for quality (crop exists, card exists, not duplicate)
  3. Generate CLIP embeddings
  4. Evaluate distinction gap (negative training!)
  5. Store templates (max 10/card)
  6. Rebuild prototypes incrementally
  7. Mark as processed

**ML Enhancements:**
- ‚úÖ Added `embed_image_bytes()` to `worker/openclip_embedder.py`
- ‚úÖ Quality scoring system
- ‚úÖ Distinction gap evaluation (0.15 minimum)
- ‚úÖ Template cap enforcement (10 per card)
- ‚úÖ Confusion matrix tracking

**Documentation:**
- ‚úÖ `docs/architecture/phase5b-auto-learning-system.md` - Full system spec
- ‚úÖ `docs/architecture/phase5b-quickstart.md` - How to use

### üêõ Worker Fixes

**Issue 1: UPSERT Conflict (Fixed)**
- Problem: `on_conflict="storage_path"` but storage_path isn't unique
- Fix: Changed to `on_conflict="id"` (primary key)

**Issue 2: View Update Errors (Fixed)**
- Problem: `UPDATE scan_uploads` (view, not table)
- Fix: Changed to `UPDATE scans` (actual table)
- Also fixed column names: `processing_status` ‚Üí `status`

**Issue 3: CLIP Model Download Failures (Fixed with Senior Dev Help!)**
- Problem: Using `pretrained='openai'` for LAION model
- OpenAI CDN doesn't host ViT-B-32-quickgelu weights
- Getting Connection timeout/404/refused errors
- Fix: Changed to `pretrained='laion2b_s34b_b79k'` (correct LAION checkpoint)
- Added `OPENCLIP_CACHE_DIR` for persistent storage
- Pre-download in Dockerfile during build (not runtime)

### üé® UI Improvements

**Processing Queue Cards:**
- Changed title from link to plain text
- Reduced font size from `var(--font-size-200)` to `var(--font-size-100)`

## Key Technical Decisions

### Phase 5b Architecture

**Template Storage:**
- Max 10 user templates per card (prevents explosion)
- Quality score 0-1 (based on distinction gap)
- Automatic replacement of lowest quality when at cap

**Negative Training:**
- Confusion matrix tracks commonly confused pairs
- Distinction gap evaluation (similarity_correct - similarity_wrong)
- Only keep templates with gap > 0.15 (clear distinction)

**Processing Strategy:**
- Batch processing (100 at a time)
- Incremental prototype rebuild (only affected cards)
- Quality filters prevent bad templates

### CLIP Model Configuration

**Critical Fix:**
```python
# WRONG (was causing timeouts):
model = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms(
    "ViT-B-32-quickgelu", 
    pretrained="openai"  # ‚ùå Wrong CDN, 404 errors
)

# CORRECT (now working):
model = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms(
    "ViT-B-32-quickgelu", 
    pretrained="laion2b_s34b_b79k",  # ‚úÖ LAION checkpoint
    cache_dir="/cache/open_clip"     # ‚úÖ Persistent storage
)
```

**Valid LAION Checkpoints:**
- `laion2b_s34b_b79k` (newest, using this)
- `laion400m_e32` (classic)
- `laion400m_e16` (alternative)

---

## Competitive Strategy Discussion

### Context: Discovered Competitor
- **Pokelenz** - Uses GPT-4o Vision API for card scanning
- Fast (2 sec/scan) but expensive ($0.20/scan)
- Monetization: Forced ads/paywall
- Can't learn from users (API limitation)

### Our Advantages
- **10x cheaper** ($0.02 vs $0.20 per scan)
- **Learning system** (Phase 5b) - they can't do this!
- **Data ownership** - we control everything
- **Better free tier** - sustainable economics
- **Customization** - full ML control

### Strategic Positioning
- They target: Casual one-time users
- We target: Serious collectors (1000+ cards)
- Different markets, can coexist
- Our moat: Auto-learning improves daily

## What to Run First (Next Session)

### 1. Verify Worker is Running
```bash
# Check Render logs
# Should see: "[BUILD] CLIP model cached successfully"
# Then: "[OK] CLIP model loaded successfully"
```

### 2. Test Scan Upload
```bash
# Upload a test scan via UI
# Verify detections appear in DB
# Check card_detections and training_feedback tables
```

### 3. Test Phase 5b (When Users Correct Cards)
```bash
# Run processor
python scripts/process_training_feedback.py --dry-run

# If good, run for real
python scripts/process_training_feedback.py

# Check results
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM template_metadata WHERE template_type = 'user_correction';
SELECT * FROM card_confusion ORDER BY confusion_count DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Key Insights

### "It Was Working Yesterday"
- Render deployments spin up new containers
- Network routing can vary between instances
- Same code, different network path = different results
- Solution: Eliminate runtime network dependencies

### ViT-B-32-quickgelu Model Discovery
- quickgelu variants are LAION models, NOT OpenAI
- Using `pretrained='openai'` for LAION model = 404
- OpenAI CDN doesn't host these weights at all
- Must use correct checkpoint: `laion2b_s34b_b79k`

### Phase 5b = Competitive Moat
- Pokelenz (competitor) uses GPT-4o Vision API
- They're stuck with whatever OpenAI provides (no learning)
- We own the learning loop (improve daily)
- This is the key differentiator - can't be copied via API

### Product-Focused Design
- User doesn't care about CLIP vs GPT-4o
- User cares about: accuracy, speed, cost, features
- Phase 5b makes accuracy improve over time
- Better UX = watching your corrections make the system smarter

---

## Database State

### Current Data:
- `scans`: 60 rows (mostly stuck in "processing")
- `card_detections`: 0 rows (cleared by migration cascade)
- `training_feedback`: 29 rows (predictions only, no corrections yet)
- `card_confusion`: 0 rows (new table)
- `template_metadata`: 0 rows (new table)
- `job_queue`: 50 rows (5 failed, rest completed/pending)

### Gallery State:
- 15,504 cards
- 46,512 templates (official + augmented)
- 0 user correction templates (Phase 5b ready but unused)

---

## Next Session Entry Points

### If Worker Works:
1. ‚úÖ Upload test scan
2. ‚úÖ Verify detections created
3. ‚úÖ User corrects some cards
4. ‚úÖ Run Phase 5b processor
5. ‚úÖ Watch templates get added
6. üìä Build Phase 5c dashboard

### If Worker Still Broken:
1. üîç Check Render logs for new error
2. üîß Debug CLIP loading
3. üß™ Test locally with `./run_worker.ps1`
4. üìñ Check open_clip documentation

### If Everything Works:
1. üéâ Celebrate - worker + Phase 5b both live!
2. üìà Start collecting user corrections
3. üèóÔ∏è Build automation (cron or real-time)
4. üìä Create metrics dashboard
5. üöÄ Focus on features that differentiate from Pokelenz

## Senior Dev Credit

Huge thanks to senior dev for diagnosing the CLIP checkpoint mismatch:
- Identified ViT-B-32-quickgelu as LAION model
- Explained OpenAI CDN doesn't host quickgelu weights
- Provided correct checkpoint: `laion2b_s34b_b79k`
- Suggested cache directory strategy
- Recommended pre-warming at build time

This saved hours of debugging! üôå

## Context for Next Agent

**User Profile:**
- Product designer (non-technical, prefers Factorio analogies)
- Building stealth side project (Pok√©mon card scanner)
- Competitor discovered (Pokelenz using GPT-4o Vision)
- Phase 5b = competitive moat (learning system they can't build)

**Communication Style:**
- Concise updates (1-2 sentences between tasks)
- Factorio analogies for complex systems
- Focus on product/UX, not just code
- Appreciates "why" behind technical decisions

**Project State:**
- Production Supabase (no local instance)
- Render worker (background service)
- Local testing via `./run_worker.ps1`
- Windows environment (PowerShell scripts)

**Current Goals:**
1. Get worker reliably processing scans
2. Start collecting user corrections
3. Watch Phase 5b improve accuracy over time
4. Build features Pokelenz can't (learning, exports, analytics)
