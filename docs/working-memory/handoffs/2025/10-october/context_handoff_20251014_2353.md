# Context Handoff - October 14, 2025 @ 11:53 PM

**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** Render redeploy in progress (arceus-worker) after config fix

---

## What we did this session
- Investigated Render failures via Events/Logs and MCP logs.
- Root cause: httpx InvalidURL due to a newline in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (non-printable ASCII in URL).
- Implemented env sanitation and validation in `worker/config.py`:
  - Strip `\r`/`\n` and surrounding quotes from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
  - Validate URL with `urlparse`; fail early with clear error if malformed.
- Committed and pushed fix: `2cb741e0` — triggers redeploy.

---

## Current deploy state
- Latest deploy: status `build_in_progress` for commit `2cb741e0` (fix: sanitize Supabase env vars).
- Previous run showed successful HF model download and failure at Supabase client init; sanitation should prevent the URL parsing crash.

---

## What's Next
1) When deploy finishes:
   - If service is healthy: proceed to UI cleanup tasks:
     - Audit `app/(app)/page.tsx` sticky header + floating filters.
     - Verify grid/table toggle and spacing on mobile/desktop.
     - Quick e2e smoke (collection, scans list, review inbox).
   - If service crashes again:
     - Open Logs → confirm env echo shows sanitized URL.
     - Capture first error; patch quickly (likely further env normalization or package/runtime tweak).

### Env on Render to verify (dashboard)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (no trailing newline/quotes)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Optional: `HF_TOKEN` if using private HF repo.

---

## Quick links
- Fix: `worker/config.py` (sanitization + URL validation)
- Worker entry: `worker/worker.py` → `startup_env_check`, `get_yolo_model`, main loop
- Blueprint: `render.yaml`
- Dockerfile: project root

---

## Notes
- Model loading from Hugging Face succeeded in prior logs; runtime deps look good.
- After health confirms, prioritize UI polish per active context.
