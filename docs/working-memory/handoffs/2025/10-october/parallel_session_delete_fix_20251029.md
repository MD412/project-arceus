# Parallel Session: Delete Fix - October 29, 2025

**Duration:** ~20 minutes  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - scan delete functionality fixed

---

## What Was Fixed

### Issue: Scan Delete Failing
- Error: "Could not find the 'deleted_at' column of 'scan_uploads'"
- Root cause: Trying to UPDATE view instead of base table
- Component: ProcessingQueueCard delete button

### Solution Applied

**1. Database Migration**
- Added `deleted_at` column to `scans` table
- Added index for performance: `idx_scans_deleted_at`
- Updated `scan_uploads` view to filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`

**2. API Fixes**
- `/api/commands/delete-scan/route.ts`: Changed `scan_uploads` → `scans`
- `/api/scans/[id]/route.ts` DELETE: Changed `scan_uploads` → `scans`

**3. CLIP Checkpoint Fix (Ongoing)**
- Changed from `laion2b_s34b_b79k` → `laion400m_e32`
- Commit: `22ac80e8`
- Render rebuilding (~10 min remaining)

---

## Files Modified

**New Migration:**
- `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_deleted_at_to_scans.sql`

**API Endpoints:**
- `app/api/commands/delete-scan/route.ts` (line 47)
- `app/api/scans/[id]/route.ts` (line 207)

**Worker Files (CLIP fix):**
- `Dockerfile` (line 62)
- `worker/clip_lookup.py` (line 29, 41)

---

## Testing Done

✅ Scan delete now works without errors  
✅ Soft-delete sets `deleted_at` timestamp  
✅ Deleted scans hidden from `scan_uploads` view  
⏳ Render deployment in progress (CLIP fix)

## Merge Instructions for Other Session

When merging this parallel work:

1. **Git Status Check:**
   - Unstaged: `app/api/commands/delete-scan/route.ts`
   - Committed: CLIP checkpoint fix (`22ac80e8`)
   - Migration already applied via MCP

2. **What to Commit:**
   ```bash
   git add app/api/commands/delete-scan/route.ts
   git commit -m "fix: update scans table directly for soft delete"
   ```

3. **Conflicts to Watch:**
   - If other session modified same API routes
   - If other session applied different migrations

4. **Render Status:**
   - Worker still deploying with `laion400m_e32` fix
   - Wait for build to complete before testing

---

## Context Sync Notes

- This was a "quick fix" parallel branch
- Main session working on Phase 5b testing
- No conflicts expected with Phase 5b work
- Render deployment shared (will affect both sessions)

---

**Quick Summary:** Fixed scan deletion by adding `deleted_at` to base table and updating APIs to use table (not view). Also fixed CLIP checkpoint mismatch. Ready to merge.
