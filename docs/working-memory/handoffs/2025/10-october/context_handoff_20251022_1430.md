**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** ✅ Modified - CardSearchInput filters and password manager investigation

---

## 🎯 Session Accomplishments

### 1. Added Dropdown Filters to CardSearchInput ✅
**Implementation:**
- Added rarity and set filters above search results
- Filters populate dynamically from search results
- Clear button to reset all filters
- Filter bar styled with teal theme and proper spacing

**UI Details:**
- 4px gaps between elements
- 8px horizontal padding
- Filters use existing button classes
- Space-evenly layout for filter bar

### 2. Password Manager Investigation 🔍
**Problem:** Password manager triggering on search fields
**Attempted Solutions:**
- Created separate SearchField component
- Built CardSearchInputV2 with different naming
- Made CardSearchInputClean with Google-style approach
- Added multiple ignore attributes

**Resolution:** User discovered password manager triggers on ALL sites (Google, Facebook, etc.) - not our bug

### 3. UI Refinements ✅
- Added 420px min-height to dropdown
- Moved empty states below filter bar
- Restored click-to-open dropdown behavior
- Fine-tuned padding and gaps throughout

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Filter System
```tsx
// Dynamic filter options from results
const uniqueRarities = Array.from(new Set(results.map(card => card.rarity).filter(Boolean)));
const uniqueSets = Array.from(new Set(results.map(card => card.set_name).filter(Boolean)));

// Filter application
const filteredResults = results.filter(card => {
  const matchesRarity = !rarityFilter || card.rarity === rarityFilter;
  const matchesSet = !setFilter || card.set_name === setFilter;
  return matchesRarity && matchesSet;
});
```

### CSS Architecture
- Filter bar uses CircuitDS button classes
- Custom spacing with 4px gaps
- Teal accent colors from design system
- Responsive dropdown with min-height

## 🐛 Known Issues

**Password Manager Popups**
- Not actually a bug in our code
- User's password manager is overly aggressive
- Triggers on all search fields across the web
- No code fix needed

## 🔍 What's Next

### Immediate (Next Session)

**1. Worker Health Monitoring** 
- Fix missing `worker_health` table
- Address `get_stuck_jobs` function errors
- Improve worker observability

**2. Test CLIP Detection**
- Verify 0.6 threshold works for card identification
- Upload test scans to validate accuracy
- Monitor false positive/negative rates

**3. Search UX Improvements**
- Consider adding recent searches
- Maybe add popular card suggestions
- Optimize filter performance for large result sets

### Future Considerations

**4. Filter Persistence**
- Save filter preferences per session
- Add more filter types (price range, condition)
- Consider filter presets
