# Context Handoff - October 17, 2025 @ 12:30 AM

**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Modal cleanup + scan review UX improvements complete

---

## üéØ Session Accomplishments

### 1. Modal System Cleanup (Completed from Oct 16)
**Legacy removal:**
- Deleted `Modal.tsx` and `modal.css` (574 lines removed)
- Migrated `RenameScanModal` to use `BaseModal`
- Created `rename-scan-modal.css` with BEM naming
- Updated `app/globals.css` imports

**CircuitDS docs updated:**
- Rewrote `app/(circuitds)/circuitds/modal/page.tsx`
- Added live examples for BaseModal, CardDetailModal, CardCorrectionModal
- Updated design principles and implementation notes

### 2. Fixed pokemontcg.io API Images Not Displaying
**Problem:** Scan review modal showing "No card image available" instead of official card images  
**Root cause:** API route checked for non-existent `c.image_url` field before `c.image_urls?.small`

**Fixed:**
- `app/api/scans/[id]/route.ts` - Corrected image extraction: `c.image_urls?.small || c.image_urls?.large`
- `hooks/useDetections.ts` - Same fix for consistency in fallback path
- Added debug logging to trace missing images

### 3. Scan Review Modal UX Improvements
**Auto-search for Unknown Cards:**
- CardCorrectionModal now auto-enables search mode when `card.id` is null or name is "Unknown Card"
- Search input auto-focuses on mount
- Better messaging: "Find Card" vs "Search Replacement Card"

**Modal stays open after save:**
- Removed auto-close behavior in `DetectionGrid.tsx` 
- User sees toast confirmation while modal stays open
- After selecting replacement, modal exits search mode and shows updated card image
- User can navigate with arrow keys or manually close

**Loading states:**
- Added `isSaving` state during API calls
- Prevents double-submission
- Errors keep modal open for retry

### 4. Type Safety Fixes
- Fixed `DetectionTile` interface: `crop_url`, `guess_card_id`, `confidence` now correctly nullable
- Added null guards for crop image rendering
- Fixed `onReviewed` callback signature

## üêõ Known Issues

**None from this session**

**Unrelated (from previous):**
- Card search performance monitoring still needed (new Supabase query from Oct 17)
- Some cards may have empty `image_urls` in database - monitor debug logs

---

## üîç What's Next

### Immediate
1. **Test modal flows** - Verify scan review workflow with real data
2. **Monitor debug logs** - Check terminal for cards missing `image_urls` data
3. **Verify pokemontcg.io images** - Ensure API images load correctly in all modals

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding keyboard shortcut hints in modal footer
- Add "Mark as Unknown" action for bad AI matches
- Implement batch correction workflow for multiple unknown cards

---

## üéì Technical Notes

**UX Pattern:**
- Modal now stays open after save = better for reviewing corrections
- Auto-search for unknowns = reduces friction for unidentified cards
- Loading states prevent double-clicks and show user feedback

**Image URL Structure:**
Database stores:
```json
{
  "image_urls": {
    "small": "https://images.pokemontcg.io/...",
    "large": "https://images.pokemontcg.io/..."
  }
}
```

**Type Safety:**
- Supabase returns `null` for missing foreign keys, not `undefined`
- Always check for `null` in detection/card relationships

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for testing  
**Next session:** Monitor image loading, test scan review flows
