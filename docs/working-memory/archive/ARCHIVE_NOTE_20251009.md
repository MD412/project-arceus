# Archive Note - October 9, 2025

**Action:** Unified three separate handoffs into single timeline  
**Date:** October 10, 2025

---

## What Changed

### Before
- `context_handoff_20251009_1512.md` (12:12 PM)
- `context_handoff_20251009_1540.md` (3:40 PM)  
- `context_handoff_20251009_1645.md` (4:45 PM)

**Problem:** Three separate handoffs for October 9 created confusion about timeline and duplicate information.

### After
- **`context_handoff_20251009_UNIFIED.md`** ← Single source of truth

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Complete chronological timeline (7.5 hours total)
- ✅ No duplicate information
- ✅ Easier to understand full day's context
- ✅ All three sessions properly documented in sequence

---

## Timeline Consolidated

### Session 1: System MRI (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
- System architecture mapped (SYSTEM_MAP.md)
- Worker validated (22 historical runs)
- Review UI cleaned up
- Living memory system created
- Found bug: `user_cards_created = 0`

### Session 2: UI Polish (4:00 PM - 5:30 PM)
- Collection page: sticky headers + glassmorphism
- Navigation simplified
- Table view: edge-to-edge layout
- Filter controls: uniform height

## Files Preserved

Original handoffs are kept in the directory for reference but are superseded by the UNIFIED version. When reading October 9 context, **always use the UNIFIED handoff**.

---

## Updated References

- ✅ `active_context.md` → points to UNIFIED
- ✅ `NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF.md` → references UNIFIED
- ✅ `README.md` → documents UNIFIED pattern

---

**Going forward:** For multi-session days, create UNIFIED handoffs instead of multiple timestamped ones.
