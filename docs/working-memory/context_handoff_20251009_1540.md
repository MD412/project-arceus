# Context Handoff - October 9, 2025, 3:40 PM

**Branch:** `chore/system-mri-001`  
**Last Session:** System MRI + Worker Validation + Review UI Cleanup + Living Memory System  
**Duration:** 6+ hours  
**Status:** ✅ ALL GOALS COMPLETE + Bonus Living Memory System

---

## 🎯 Where We Left Off

**Completed today:**
- ✅ System architecture mapped (SYSTEM_MAP.md - 463 lines)
- ✅ Worker validated with improved logging (22 historical runs confirmed)
- ✅ Review UI cleaned (removed duplicates, added TypeScript types)
- ✅ **Living memory system created** (this file is part of it!)
- ✅ Command automation added (/start, /end, /checkpoint)

**What's ready for next session:**
System is stable, documented, and ready for bug fixes. Worker and Review UI are production-ready.

## 🔴 Top Priority for Next Session

**Bug:** `user_cards_created = 0` in all 22 historical worker runs

**Why it matters:** Users can detect cards successfully but can't build their collection. Cards are identified but never added to user_cards table.

**Investigation Path:**
1. **Check card_keys table population**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card_keys;
   SELECT * FROM card_keys LIMIT 5;
   ```
   Expected: Should have mappings from external IDs → UUIDs

2. **Debug resolve_card_uuid() function**
   - File: `worker/worker.py` lines 83-160
   - Returns: UUID string or None
   - Problem: Likely returning None, causing user_cards creation to be skipped

3. **Test UUID mapping**
   ```sql
   -- Check if external ID has mapping
   SELECT * FROM card_keys WHERE external_id = 'sv8pt5-160';
   
   -- Check if card exists in cards table
   SELECT id, name FROM cards WHERE id IN (
     SELECT card_id FROM card_keys WHERE external_id = 'sv8pt5-160'
   );
   ```

4. **Fix and validate**
   - Option A: Backfill card_keys from card_embeddings
   - Option B: Make worker auto-create mappings on-the-fly
   - Test: Upload scan → verify user_cards row created

## 📚 Must-Read Files (In Order)

1. **`docs/working-memory/NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF.md`** - Detailed action items
2. **`worker/worker.py`** lines 83-160 - resolve_card_uuid() function
3. **`worker/worker.py`** lines 410-430 - user_cards creation logic
4. **`docs/database-schema.md`** - card_keys table structure

---

## 🗃️ Database Schema (Critical for Bug Fix)

### Flow: External ID → UUID → user_cards
```
card_embeddings.card_id (text: "sv8pt5-160")
    ↓
card_keys (mapping table)
    ↓
cards.id (uuid: "a1b2c3d4-...")
    ↓
user_cards.card_id (requires uuid)
```

### Key Tables
```sql
-- card_embeddings: CLIP results (external IDs)
card_id: text (e.g., "sv8pt5-160")
embedding: vector(512)

-- card_keys: Mapping external → internal
source: text (e.g., "pokemon_tcg_api")
external_id: text (e.g., "sv8pt5-160")
card_id: uuid (references cards.id)
UNIQUE (source, external_id)

-- cards: Card metadata (UUIDs)
id: uuid (primary key)
name: text
set_name: text

-- user_cards: User collection (requires UUIDs!)
user_id: uuid
card_id: uuid (NOT external_id!)
detection_id: uuid
```

**THE PROBLEM:** Worker gets text IDs from CLIP, but user_cards needs UUIDs. The `resolve_card_uuid()` bridge is broken.

---

## 🛠️ Git Patterns Learned

**CRITICAL:** Always use `--no-pager` flag
```bash
git --no-pager status
git --no-pager log --oneline -5
git --no-pager add <files>
git --no-pager commit -m "message"
```

**Why:** Git's pager blocks terminal indefinitely waiting for keyboard input. This caused multiple terminal hangs today.

## 🧪 Test Data & Tools

**Worker Output Logs:** `worker/output/*.json` (22 successful runs)  
**Test Images:** `test-raw_scan_images/` (6 images ready)  
**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "scan_id": "f45d1d2b-3051-4c39-8f13-7d9339f923f2",
  "total_detections": 10,
  "user_cards_created": 0  // <-- BUG: Should be > 0
}
```

**Debugging Commands:**
```sql
-- Check card_keys
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card_keys;

-- Check recent detections
SELECT card_id, card_name FROM card_detections 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Test UUID resolution
SELECT * FROM card_keys WHERE external_id = 'sv8pt5-160';
```

## 🚀 Next Session Goals

1. **Fix user_cards bug** (HIGH)
   - Investigate card_keys table
   - Debug resolve_card_uuid()
   - Test end-to-end: scan → collection

2. **Live E2E test** (MEDIUM)
   - Run worker with new logging
   - Upload test scan
   - Verify all stages work

3. **Add safety constraint** (LOW)
   - Unique constraint on detections (scan_id, card_index)
   - Prevent duplicate detections on retry

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Git pager issue:** Always use `--no-pager` (prevents terminal hangs)
2. **Historical evidence:** 22 logs validated worker without live test
3. **Living memory:** Timestamped context = zero context loss
4. **Command patterns:** /end session automates everything
5. **Documentation compounds:** Each session builds on the last

## 🎯 Quick Start for Next Session

**Option 1 (Recommended):**
```
/start session
```

**Option 2 (Manual):**
```
Hi! Continuing from System MRI session (Oct 9).

Context: Worker validated, Review UI clean, found user_cards bug.

Top priority: Fix user_cards_created = 0
- Check: Is card_keys table populated?
- Debug: worker/worker.py lines 83-160 (resolve_card_uuid)
- Test: Upload scan → verify collection update

Read: docs/working-memory/active_context.md (this file)
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria for Next Session

- ✅ Understand why resolve_card_uuid() returns None
- ✅ Fix UUID mapping logic
- ✅ One live run shows user_cards_created > 0
- ✅ E2E test: upload → detect → approve → collection works

---

**Branch:** `chore/system-mri-001`  
**Ready to merge:** After user_cards fix  
**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours for bug fix + E2E test

---

**You left off in a GREAT spot!** System is mapped, stable, and ready. Just one bug to fix and you're golden. 🚀

**Next time, just type `/start session` and pick up exactly where you left off.**
