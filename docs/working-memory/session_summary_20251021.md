# Session Summary - October 21, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Accomplishments

### âœ… Table Content Fixes
- **Auto-generated scan titles** - "Scan 0001 - 10222025" format instead of "Untitled Scan"
- **Actual card counts** - Display real detection counts from database (not hardcoded 0)
- **Specific dates** - Show "Oct 22, 2025" instead of "X days ago" relative dates

### âœ… Table Column Alignment
- **Centered status tags** - Proper alignment with `.circuit-table-cell--center`
- **Right-aligned uploaded dates** - Consistent numeric alignment
- **Always-visible action buttons** - Removed hover-only behavior for better UX

### âœ… Password Manager Blocking
- **Search field fixes** - Added `autoComplete="off"`, `data-lpignore="true"`, `type="search"`
- **Multiple components updated** - CardSearchInput, SearchBar, external search
- **No more popups** - Password managers no longer interfere with search fields

### âœ… CLIP Detection Optimization
- **Fixed "Unknown Card" issue** - Lowered similarity threshold from 0.85 to 0.6
- **Confirmed data quality** - 19,411 high-quality embeddings available (not just 5)
- **Balanced accuracy vs coverage** - More matches found with acceptable accuracy

## ðŸ”§ Technical Insights

### Database Query Improvements
- Fetch actual detection counts with proper aggregation
- Generate sequential scan titles with date formatting
- Handle empty/null title cases gracefully

### ML Pipeline Optimization
- CLIP threshold tuning for real-world usage patterns
- Worker efficiency improvements (starts/stops based on job queue)
- Cost optimization (no 24/7 Render billing)

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Consistent table alignment across components
- Improved accessibility with always-visible actions
- Clean user experience without external tool interference

## ðŸ“Š Files Modified (6 total)

**Frontend:** 4 files (ScanHistoryTable, CardSearchInput components, SearchBar)
**Backend:** 1 file (services/jobs.ts)
**Worker:** 1 file (worker/worker.py)
**Styles:** 1 file (table.css)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Session Priorities

1. **Test CLIP accuracy** - Upload scan to verify card identification works
2. **Worker monitoring** - Fix missing health functions and error handling
3. **Detection quality** - Analyze YOLO crop quality vs CLIP accuracy

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

- **CLIP thresholds** need real-world tuning (0.85 too strict, 0.6 better balance)
- **Password managers** require multiple blocking strategies for reliability
- **Table content** should be dynamic and accurate, not placeholder text
- **Worker efficiency** - smart start/stop behavior saves significant costs
