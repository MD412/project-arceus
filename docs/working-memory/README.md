# Working Memory System

**Purpose:** Preserve session context and enable seamless continuity between coding sessions.

📂 **New to the system?** See [ORGANIZATION.md](./ORGANIZATION.md) for a complete guide to the folder structure and how it scales.

```

**Design Philosophy:** Organize by **type** → **year** → **month** for easy scaling to thousands of files.

**Note:** For multi-session days, prefer creating a UNIFIED handoff that consolidates the full timeline rather than multiple timestamped handoffs.

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. During a Session
Work normally. The AI will create planning docs as needed:
- `SYSTEM_MAP.md` (architecture overview)
- `TRIAGE_PLAN.md` (session goals)
- Session-specific investigations

### 2. At Session End
The AI creates two files:

**Context Handoff** (`context_handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`):
- What was accomplished
- Where we left off
- Investigation paths for next session
- Critical code locations
- Database schema snippets
- Git patterns learned

**Session Summary** (`session_summary_YYYYMMDD.md`):
- High-level overview
- Commits made
- Metrics (files changed, lines added)
- Key learnings
- Next priorities

### 3. Starting Next Session
Copy the "Quick Start" section from latest context handoff and paste into new chat:

```
Hi! Continuing from session on [date].

Context: [Brief summary of where we left off]

Goals today:
1. [Top priority]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

Please read docs/working-memory/context_handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md first.
```

## 🔄 Unified vs. Timestamped Handoffs

### When to Use UNIFIED Handoffs
If you have **multiple sessions in one day**, create a single UNIFIED handoff that merges the full timeline:

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single coherent narrative
- ✅ No duplicate information
- ✅ Easier to pick up context
- ✅ Shows progression throughout the day

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Context Handoff - October 9, 2025 (UNIFIED)

## Session Timeline
### Session 1: System MRI (12:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
[accomplishments]

### Session 2: UI Polish (4:00 PM - 5:30 PM)
[accomplishments]

## Combined Priorities
[unified view of all work]
```

### When to Use Timestamped Handoffs
For **single sessions** or when you want to preserve individual session context:

**Format:** `context_handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md` (e.g., `context_handoff_20251009_1430.md`)

**Use case:** One session per day, or when sessions are days apart

## 🔄 Workflow Guide

### Command Patterns (For Humans)

Use these commands to trigger automatic session management:

**`/end session`** - Wrap up and create handoff docs
```
/end session

AI will:
1. Create context_handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md (timestamped)
2. Create session_summary_YYYYMMDD.md (daily wrap-up)
3. Update active_context.md (copy of latest handoff)
4. Update NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF.md (if goals changed)
5. Commit everything with descriptive message
6. Show "Ready for next session" confirmation
```

**`/start session`** - Quick context load
```
/start session

AI will:
1. Read docs/working-memory/active_context.md
2. Read NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF.md
3. Summarize where we left off
4. Highlight top priorities
5. Ask: "Ready to continue? What's first?"
```

**`/checkpoint`** - Mid-session snapshot (optional)
```
/checkpoint [label]

AI will:
1. Create context_checkpoint_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_[label].md
2. Capture current progress without ending session
3. Useful before risky changes or long breaks
```

### For the Human (Manual Process)
1. **End of session:** Type `/end session`
2. **Start of session:** Type `/start session` or just reference `active_context.md`
3. **Weekly cleanup:** Archive handoffs older than 30 days

### For the AI (Automation Logic)

**When user types `/end session`:**
1. **Create timestamped handoff:** `context_handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`
   - Where we left off (2-3 sentences)
   - Top priority for next session
   - Investigation paths with file locations
   - Database schema (if relevant)
   - Git patterns learned
   - Quick start message for next chat

2. **Create session summary:** `session_summary_YYYYMMDD.md`
   - What was accomplished
   - Commits made
   - Files changed metrics
   - Key discoveries
   - Next priorities

3. **Update active_context.md:** Copy of latest handoff

4. **Update NEXT_SESSION_BRIEF.md:** Refresh based on progress

5. **Commit all docs:** 
   ```bash
   git --no-pager add docs/working-memory/
   git --no-pager commit -m "docs: end session YYYYMMDD_HHMM - [brief summary]"
   ```

6. **Show confirmation:**
   ```
   ✅ Session ended successfully!
   
   Created:
   - context_handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md
   - session_summary_YYYYMMDD.md
   - Updated active_context.md
   
   Next session: Just type /start session
   ```

**When user types `/start session`:**
1. Read `docs/working-memory/active_context.md`
2. Summarize: "Last session we [X]. Top priority: [Y]."
3. Ask: "Ready to continue with [priority]?"

**When user types `/checkpoint [label]`:**
1. Create `context_checkpoint_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_[label].md`
2. Include current state, open questions, next steps
3. Don't end session, just snapshot
4. Commit with message: `"docs: checkpoint - [label]"`

## 📖 File Naming Convention

### Context Handoffs (Detailed, for AI consumption)
```
context_handoff_20251009_1430.md
context_handoff_20251010_0900.md
context_handoff_20251010_1500.md
```
- Format: `context_handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`
- When: End of every session
- Purpose: Give next AI complete context

### Session Summaries (High-level, for human review)
```
session_summary_20251009.md
session_summary_20251010_morning.md
session_summary_20251010_afternoon.md
```
- Format: `session_summary_YYYYMMDD[_label].md`
- When: End of every session
- Purpose: Human-readable progress log

### Active Context (Always latest)
```
active_context.md
```
- Symlink or copy of most recent context handoff
- Makes it easy to find "where am I now?"

---

## 🎨 Best Practices

### ✅ Do This
- **Timestamp everything** for traceability
- **Be specific** about file locations (with line numbers)
- **Include code snippets** for critical logic
- **Document git patterns** learned (like `--no-pager`)
- **List test data locations** explicitly
- **Provide debugging commands** ready to copy-paste

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Don't create generic handoffs ("we worked on stuff")
- Don't skip the quick start message
- Don't forget to commit handoffs to git
- Don't let handoffs exceed 500 lines (split into multiple docs)

---

## 🔍 Finding Information

### "Where did we leave off?"
```bash
# View latest handoff
cat docs/working-memory/active_context.md

# Or list all recent handoffs
ls -lt docs/working-memory/handoffs/2025/10-october/*.md | head -5
```

### "What did we accomplish last week?"
```bash
# View all session summaries
ls docs/working-memory/summaries/2025/10-october/

# Read specific day
cat docs/working-memory/summaries/2025/10-october/session_summary_20251009.md
```

### "What was the context at a specific time?"
```bash
# Find handoff from October 9, 2pm
cat docs/working-memory/handoffs/2025/10-october/context_handoff_20251009_1400.md
```

### "Find bug investigations or reports"
```bash
# List all reports for current month
ls docs/working-memory/reports/2025/10-october/

# Read specific investigation
cat docs/working-memory/reports/2025/10-october/bug_investigation_user_cards_20251010.md
```

---

## 📊 Maintenance

### Weekly Cleanup
1. Review handoffs from past week
2. Move superseded handoffs to `archived/` subfolder:
   ```bash
   # Move old handoffs that were replaced by UNIFIED versions
   mv docs/working-memory/handoffs/2025/10-october/context_handoff_20251009_*.md `
      docs/working-memory/handoffs/2025/10-october/archived/
   ```
3. Keep `active_context.md` and core reference files in root

### Monthly Review
1. Read all session summaries
2. Extract patterns and learnings
3. Update main `SYSTEM_MAP.md` if architecture changed
4. Create monthly progress report (optional)

---

## 🚀 Quick Reference

**Starting a session:**
```
/start session
```

**Ending a session:**
```
/end session
```

**Mid-session snapshot:**
```
/checkpoint [label]
```

**Manual reference:**
```
@docs/working-memory/active_context.md 
Help me continue from last session
```

---

## 💡 Why This Works

1. **Searchable history:** Timestamped files = easy to find context
2. **AI-friendly:** Structured format = consistent handoffs
3. **Human-friendly:** Session summaries = quick progress review
4. **Git-tracked:** All context committed = never lose progress
5. **Scalable:** Folder structure supports growth

---

## 🎓 Learning from Sessions

Over time, this folder becomes a **knowledge base**:
- Common patterns emerge (e.g., "always use --no-pager")
- Bug investigation paths get refined
- Best practices crystallize
- Onboarding new devs becomes trivial (just read recent handoffs)

**Use this system to build institutional memory, one session at a time.** 🧠✨
