# Session Summary - October 29, 2025 @ 10:00 PM

**Focus:** Fixed worker OOM crashes + enabled retrieval v2 + memory optimizations

---

## 🎯 Key Accomplishments

### Critical Fixes
- **OOM Crashes Resolved:** Added explicit memory cleanup (`gc.collect()` + tensor deletion) after every CLIP batch
- **Memory Reduced:** ~2.0-2.5GB peak → ~1.5-1.8GB steady (fits Render Standard 2GB limit)
- **v2 System Enabled:** Switched from empty legacy system to populated gallery (46k+ templates)

### Performance Improvements
- **Timeout Handling:** Reduced TopK 100→50, auto-retry with 25 on timeout
- **Text Encoder Trimmed:** Removed unused components (~200-300MB saved)
- **Error Resilience:** Network error handling, graceful degradation

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `UnboundLocalError: torch` (duplicate import in cleanup)
- Fixed visibility timeout fallback (removed deprecated column)
- Suppressed harmless warnings (QuickGELU, network errors)

## 📊 Test Results

**Local Testing:**
- ✅ 3 scans processed (9, 12, 10 detections)
- ✅ 31/31 cards identified correctly (100% accuracy)
- ✅ No OOM crashes
- ✅ Memory stable ~1.5-1.8GB
- ✅ Better on basic cards vs full art (expected - more gallery examples)

## 📁 Files Modified

- `worker/worker.py` - Memory cleanup, error handling
- `worker/clip_lookup.py` - Memory optimization, debug logs
- `worker/openclip_embedder.py` - Tensor cleanup, warnings
- `worker/retrieval_v2.py` - Timeout retry logic
- `worker/config.py` - Default RETRIEVAL_IMPL=v2, TopK=50
- `Dockerfile` - Checkpoint fix

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Immediate:**
- Deploy to Render (push → auto-deploy)
- Monitor logs for OOM (should stay <2GB)
- Test live scan processing

**This Week:**
- Phase 5b learning loop (improve full art accuracy)
- Monitor production memory usage
- Collect user corrections

**Status:** Worker fixed, tested, ready for production deploy ✅
