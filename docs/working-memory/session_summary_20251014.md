# Session Summary â€” October 14, 2025

- Added Cursor slash commands: `/start-session`, `/end-session`
- Cleaned working-memory docs; linked commands from `active_context.md`
- Fixed Render deployment:
  - Corrected malformed Supabase env URL
  - Updated envs via Render MCP and redeployed
  - Switched worker service plan to higher RAM; deployment live
- Verified logs: YOLO/CLIP load, Supabase OK, worker healthy
- Late session: diagnosed missing jobs, suspected RPC signature drift; advised direct retry endpoint + MCP reload

Next:
- Reload MCP servers; query `job_queue`, `scan_uploads`, and `enqueue_scan_job` definition
- Enqueue a test job (retry endpoint) and observe Render logs
