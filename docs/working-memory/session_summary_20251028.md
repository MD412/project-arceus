# Session Summary - October 28, 2025

## Quick Highlights

- 🔐 Fixed Git Guardian alert: `.cursor/mcp.json` token leak
- 🐛 Fixed scan titles showing UUIDs instead of "Untitled Scan"
- 📊 Fixed card count display (was hardcoded to 0)
- 🗄️ Cleaned legacy database tables causing confusion
- 🔧 Fixed worker duplicate constraint error (upsert vs insert)
- 🛠️ Created local worker test script (`run_worker.ps1`)

## Root Cause Discovery

**Mystery:** User saw working detections on Oct 27, zero today

**Investigation:** 
- Phase 5a migration deleted duplicate scans
- Foreign key CASCADE deleted October detections (76 rows)
- Worker was always working correctly
- Data loss was from migration side effect

**Resolution:**
- Cleaned up database (removed 133 orphaned records + legacy tables)
- Fixed worker upsert issue for future scans
- Awaiting Render deployment to test fresh scans

## Status

**Working:** Frontend displays, database queries, local test setup  
**Deploying:** Worker fix on Render  
**Next:** Test fresh scan upload after deployment completes

## Files Changed

- `.gitignore`, `services/jobs.ts`, `worker/worker.py`, `run_worker.ps1`
- 4 new migrations (view fix, RLS bypass, legacy cleanup, table drops)

## Next Session

Upload test scan → verify detections appear → Phase 5b auto-learning
