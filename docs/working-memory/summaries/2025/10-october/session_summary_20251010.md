## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### 1. user_cards Bug Already Fixed
**Investigation finding:** Bug was resolved on October 8, 2025

**Evidence:**
- Last worker run (Oct 8, 17:33) created 7 user_cards successfully
- Code change from `source="sv_text"` to `source="clip"` fixed the issue
- All 3 fallback steps in `resolve_card_uuid()` working correctly
- Historical "failures" are old data from before the fix

**Database state:**
- card_keys: 35 mappings (8 "clip", 27 "sv_text")
- cards: 19,411 cards with pokemon_tcg_api_id
- user_cards: 38 records (7 from successful scan)

**Conclusion:** No action needed ✅

### 2. Mobile Padding Bug
**User feedback:** "The main window still has inner padding"

**Root cause:** Three mobile media queries forcing padding with `!important`, overriding `.app-content--no-padding` class

**Fix:** Changed selectors to `.app-content:not(.app-content--no-padding)`

**Result:** Edge-to-edge layout now works on mobile ✅

### 3. Documentation Organization
**Problem:** Three separate Oct 9 handoffs created confusion

**Solution:** Unified into single chronological document

**Benefit:** Single source of truth for full day context

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Technical
1. **CSS Specificity:** Use `:not()` selector to avoid `!important` conflicts
2. **Browser Automation:** Good for structure, limited for visual validation
3. **Bug Investigation:** Historical data ≠ current bugs (check timestamps!)
4. **Mobile Media Queries:** Multiple breakpoints can all need updating

### Process
1. **Unified Handoffs:** Better than fragmented timelines for multi-session days
2. **Automated Testing:** Validates structure but can't replace visual checks
3. **User Feedback:** Direct observation beats assumptions every time
4. **Git Hygiene:** Regular commits keep work clean and organized
