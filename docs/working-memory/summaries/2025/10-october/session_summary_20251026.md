# Session Summary - October 26, 2025

**Focus:** Fixed retrieval v2 worker integration & defined Phase 5 simplified learning

---

## Key Accomplishments

### ðŸ”§ Fixed Worker to Use Retrieval v2
- Worker was ignoring `RETRIEVAL_IMPL=v2` env var
- Updated `worker.py` to conditionally use new pipeline
- Deployed fix to Render

### ðŸŽ¯ Solved User's Greavard Problem
- Found user's actual scan misidentified as Great Tusk (8 times!)
- Added their real scan as template for sv3-92
- Result: Perfect match (0.9592 score, template=1.0)

### ðŸ“‹ Designed Phase 5: Simple Learning System
- Single `training_feedback` table as source of truth
- Tracks: crops â†’ predictions â†’ corrections â†’ training status
- Much simpler than original distributed plan

---

## Technical Insights

- **Test fixtures â‰  Real usage**: We were testing with wrong images
- **Domain gap confirmed**: User scan vs official art = huge difference
- **Clean scans dominate**: Template similarity 1.0 beats everything

---

## Files Created
- Multiple debugging/testing scripts
- User's actual Greavard crop downloaded
- Worker v2 integration fixes

---

## Next Session

**Phase 5a Implementation:**
1. Create `training_feedback` table
2. Log every identification attempt
3. Add correction UI
4. Start collecting real training data

## Status
âœ… Retrieval v2 working with user's actual scans
ðŸ”œ Phase 5 self-learning infrastructure
