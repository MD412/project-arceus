# Session Summary - October 16, 2025

**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Focus:** Collection page UI cleanup and polish

---

## Highlights

✅ **Header Consolidation**
- Merged filters directly into header (three-column layout: Title | Stats | Filters)
- Changed h1 → h5 for more compact title (26px → 18px)
- Removed "Welcome back" message
- Set sticky top to 0px (flush with page)
- Removed vertical padding from header

✅ **Table View Fixed**
- Table header now sticky within its scroll container (not page scroll)
- Proper flex container hierarchy for scroll behavior
- Edge-to-edge layout when in table mode

✅ **Padding Cleanup**
- Removed double padding (card-grid + cards-section)
- Uniform 12px padding on `.cards-section`
- Edge-to-edge for table view

✅ **Card Size Slider (Disabled for Future)**
- Fully implemented floating slider with localStorage
- Dynamic grid sizing with auto-fill
- Glassmorphism styling
- Disabled because original breakpoints are carefully tuned
- Documented in `docs/future-features/card-size-slider.md`

---

## Files Changed

- `app/(app)/page.tsx` - Header restructure, padding fixes
- `app/styles/trading-card.css` - Reverted to original breakpoints
- `docs/future-features/card-size-slider.md` - NEW feature documentation

---

## Next Steps

1. Modal consistency (user got tired before specifying fixes)
2. Optionally re-enable card size slider with improvements
3. Check Render worker deploy status
