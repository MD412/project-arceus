**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Focus:** Fix card detail modal image clipping

---

## ✅ Completed

- **Fixed CardDetailModal image clipping** - Cards no longer cut off at top/bottom
- **Refactored layout from Grid → Flexbox** - Better height constraint handling
- **Reduced padding** - More vertical space for card images
- **Tested with browser automation** - Verified fix with multiple attempts

---

## 📝 Key Changes

- `app/styles/card-detail-modal.css`:
  - Changed `.card-detail-modal__layout` from grid to flex
  - Both columns use `flex: 1` for equal distribution  
  - Image container uses flex centering
  - Proper `min-height: 0` on flex children
  - Reduced layout padding for more space

---

## 🎯 Result

Card images now display completely within modal bounds with proper aspect ratio maintained.

## 📚 Learnings

- Flexbox handles height constraints better than Grid for this use case
- `min-height: 0` crucial for flex items to shrink properly
- Grid row sizing can cause overflow when mixed with `height: 100%` images
- Browser automation helpful for iterative CSS debugging
