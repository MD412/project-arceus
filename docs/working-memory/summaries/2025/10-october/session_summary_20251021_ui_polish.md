**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Focus:** Responsive layout fixes, dropdown UX, UI polish

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Language Work Shelved
- Started implementing language filter (toggle UI, API support)
- User decided to defer ‚Üí reverted all changes
- Removed language dropdown from CardDetailModal
- Deleted migration: `20251021000000_add_language_to_cards.sql`

### Collection Filter Responsive Fixes
- Fixed spacing issues across mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints
- Changed toolbar from grid to flex (stays horizontal until mobile)
- Removed toolbar padding to prevent flex-wrap gap issues
- Added 12px top/bottom padding to header (with !important for Next.js scoping)

### Dropdown UX Improvements
- Added Spotify-style floating scrollbars (transparent track, semi-transparent thumb)
- Implemented max-height: 75vh with custom scrollbar
- Added smart auto-positioning (switches left/right to prevent cutoff)
- Increased max-width to 400px for longer text
- Added ellipsis + tooltips for overflow

### Set Names Display
- Changed from codes (swsh12) to full names (Silver Tempest)
- Updated data structure: `SetOption[]` with code + name
- Dropdown displays names, filters by codes internally

### Borderless UI Polish
- Removed borders from search input
- Removed borders from filter buttons
- Clean minimal aesthetic with opacity-based backgrounds

## üéì Technical Learnings

**Next.js CSS Scoping:**
- Next.js auto-adds `jsx-` hash classes for scoping
- Creates specificity issues (`.header.jsx-hash` beats `.header`)
- Solutions: !important, more specific names, or CSS Modules
- User context: Transitioning from classic HTML/CSS workflow

**Flex-Wrap Gap Issue:**
- `gap` applies to both axes when wrapping occurs
- Solution: Use `flex-direction: column` for mobile, `nowrap` for desktop

**Floating Scrollbar Technique:**
- Transparent track + margin to avoid corners
- `background-clip: padding-box` creates floating effect
- Works in WebKit and Firefox

---
