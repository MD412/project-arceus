## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Scalable File Organization

**Pattern discovered:** Type → Year → Month
- Better than flat structure (overwhelms at 20+ files)
- Better than date-only (hard to find by category)
- Better than feature-based (context spans features)

**Scaling math:**
- Week 1: 10 files → Easy to browse
- Month 3: 100 files → Navigable by month
- Year 2: 1,000 files → Year folders prevent overcrowding
- Year 5: 10,000 files → Old years can be archived

### Autism-Friendly Design

**What makes it work:**
1. Clear categories (no ambiguity)
2. Consistent naming patterns
3. Visual hierarchy
4. No random outlier files
5. Archive subfolders for old docs

**User feedback:** "Autism brain triggered by random outlier files"  
**Solution:** Everything categorized, nothing random
