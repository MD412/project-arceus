## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### CSS Layout Insights
1. **Global class conflicts:** The global `.container` class in `app/globals.css` was applying unwanted padding. Renamed page container to `.collection-page` to resolve.

2. **Sticky positioning quirks:** Content must scroll *inside* the same container as sticky elements for backdrop effects to work properly.

3. **Height filling pattern:** For uniform toolbar control heights, use:
   - Parent container: natural height
   - Child controls: `height: 100%` or `align-self: stretch`

4. **Overflow cascade:** When nested containers have `overflow`, sticky positioning can break. Solution: carefully control which container is the scroll container.

### Glassmorphism Effect Pattern
```css
background: rgba(27, 62, 66, 0.85);
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
```

## 🚀 Ready for Next Session

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Test responsive behavior** - All changes were desktop-focused; need mobile/tablet testing
2. **Commit changes** - Current work is uncommitted

### Future Enhancements
- Add smooth scroll behavior
- Loading states for filters
- Accessibility audit for glass effects
- Further table view polish (user noted "not perfect but good stopping point")

---

## 📝 Notes

- User was pleased with progress but acknowledged table view needs minor refinements
- No database or backend changes this session
- All work was pure frontend UI/UX polish
- Working Memory System now in use for session handoffs

**Next Session:** Continue with responsive testing or move on to other priorities per `TRIAGE_PLAN.md`
