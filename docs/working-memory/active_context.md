# Active Context - Project Arceus

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025 (11:53 PM)  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** 🚀 Render redeploy in progress (arceus-worker) after env sanitization fix

---

## 🎯 Current Status

Render background worker is deploying (Hugging Face model loading wired). Next action depends on deploy outcome:

- If deploy SUCCEEDS: focus on UI regressions (sticky header/filters/table/grid, mobile).
- If deploy FAILS: continue worker deploy debugging (check Render logs; patch fast).

## 🔴 Priority (after deploy success): UI cleanup

- Split modal implementations and scope styles
- Verify table/grid switch and sticky header behavior
- Mobile spacing and overflow fixes

## 🚫 Deferred (Don't Touch Yet)

- ❌ Manual DevTools responsive testing (do after merge)
- ❌ Live worker test (optional validation)
- ❌ Trace ID propagation

**Next steps:** Conditional on redeploy outcome (UI cleanup if healthy; continue debugging otherwise)
