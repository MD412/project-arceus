# Active Context - Project Arceus

**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025 @ 3:00 PM  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** 🔄 Phase 5b deployed, Worker fixed, Render rebuilding with LAION checkpoint

---

## 🎯 Current Status

**Session Focus:** Built Phase 5b auto-learning system + fixed worker CLIP model issues

### Latest Session (Oct 29, 3:00 PM)
- ✅ **Phase 5b COMPLETE** - Auto-learning system (competitive moat!)
- ✅ Fixed worker UPSERT conflict (`on_conflict="id"`)
- ✅ Fixed worker view updates (`UPDATE scans` not `scan_uploads`)
- ✅ Fixed CLIP model checkpoint (LAION not OpenAI)
- ✅ Pre-download model in Docker build
- ✅ UI: Changed processing card title styling
- 🔄 Render deploying worker with correct LAION model

**Ready for:**
- Fresh scan upload test after Render deployment
- User corrections → run Phase 5b processor
- Watch accuracy improve over time!

## 🔴 Top Priorities

### 1. Verify Worker Deployment (IMMEDIATE)
- Wait for Render build to complete (~10 min)
- Check logs for: "[BUILD] CLIP model cached successfully"
- Upload fresh scan → verify detections created
- Confirm no timeout/404 errors

### 2. Test Phase 5b Auto-Learning
- User corrects wrong card IDs
- Run `python scripts/process_training_feedback.py`
- Verify templates added to gallery
- Check confusion matrix populated
- Watch accuracy improve!

### 3. Build Phase 5c Dashboard (Next)
- Show ML quality metrics
- Top confused cards
- Templates added over time
- Accuracy trend graph
- User impact visualization

### 4. Differentiate from Pokelenz (Competitor)
- Auto-learning (they can't do this!)
- Better free tier (10x cheaper per scan)
- Export to marketplaces
- Portfolio analytics
- Offline mode

## 🔧 Technical State

### Phase 5b: Auto-Learning (NEW!)
- ✅ `card_confusion` table - Tracks confused pairs
- ✅ `template_metadata` table - Manages template quality
- ✅ `scripts/process_training_feedback.py` - 7-step factory pipeline
- ✅ Quality scoring + distinction gap evaluation
- ✅ Template cap: 10 user corrections per card
- ✅ Negative training (confusion matrix)

### CLIP Model Configuration (FIXED!)
- Model: `ViT-B-32-quickgelu`
- Checkpoint: `laion2b_s34b_b79k` (was `openai` - wrong!)
- Cache: `/cache/open_clip` (persistent)
- Pre-download: Baked into Docker image (~1.6GB)
- Result: No runtime download, instant startup ✅

### Retrieval System
- Retrieval v2 live with `UNKNOWN_THRESHOLD=0.80`
- Gallery: 15,504 cards, 46,512+ templates
- Test accuracy: 100% on fixture set
- Domain gap fixed: clean scan templates
- **NEW:** Ready to add user correction templates!

### Database
- Phase 5a: `training_feedback` table (29 rows logged)
- Phase 5b: `card_confusion` + `template_metadata` tables (new)
- Legacy tables removed (scan_images, scan_batches, user_card_instances)
- Active system: `scans` + `card_detections` only

## 📊 Latest Session Summary

**Phase 5b Built:**
- Database foundation (2 new tables)
- Processing pipeline (harvest → filter → embed → evaluate → store → rebuild)
- Quality controls (distinction gap, template cap, confusion tracking)
- Documentation (system map + quick start guide)

**Worker Fixed:**
- UPSERT on correct field (`id` not `storage_path`)
- UPDATE correct table (`scans` not `scan_uploads` view)
- Correct CLIP checkpoint (`laion2b_s34b_b79k` not `openai`)
- Pre-download in Docker (no runtime network dependency)

**Competitor Discovered:**
- Pokelenz uses GPT-4o Vision ($0.20/scan, can't learn)
- We use self-hosted CLIP ($0.02/scan, learns daily)
- Phase 5b = our competitive moat (they can't build this!)
