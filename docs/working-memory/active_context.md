**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 5b deployed, Worker optimized, Ready for testing

---

## 🎯 Current Status

**Session Focus:** Built Phase 5b auto-learning system + fixed worker + optimized deploys

### Latest Session (Oct 29, 4:00 PM) - SESSION COMPLETE
- ✅ **Phase 5b COMPLETE** - Auto-learning system (competitive moat!)
- ✅ Fixed worker UPSERT + view updates
- ✅ Fixed CLIP model (LAION checkpoint)
- ✅ Optimized Docker (16 min → 75 sec deploys)
- ✅ Fixed scan delete (deleted_at column)
- ✅ Fixed command_queue table
- ✅ Merged parallel session work
- 🔄 Render deploying (CLIP downloading, ~5-10 min)

**Ready for:**
- Fresh scan upload test
- User corrections
- Run Phase 5b processor
- Watch accuracy improve! 📈

## 🔴 Top Priorities

### 1. Test Worker (IMMEDIATE - After Render Deploy)
- Wait for Render build to complete (~5-10 min)
- Upload fresh scan via UI
- Verify detections created
- Check logs: no timeout/404 errors

### 2. Start Phase 5b Learning Loop
- Get users correcting wrong card IDs
- Run `python scripts/process_training_feedback.py`
- Verify templates added to gallery
- Watch accuracy improve from 95% → 97%+

### 3. Build Phase 5c Dashboard (Next Feature)
- Show ML quality metrics to users
- Top confused cards
- Templates added over time
- Accuracy trend graph
- User impact visualization ("Your corrections improved accuracy by X%")

### 4. Differentiate from Pokelenz (Ongoing)
- **Auto-learning** (they can't do this!) ✅ Built
- Better free tier (10x cheaper economics)
- Export to TCGPlayer/eBay
- Portfolio analytics
- Offline mode

## 🔧 Technical State

### Phase 5b: Auto-Learning System ✅
- `card_confusion` table - tracks confused pairs
- `template_metadata` table - manages template quality
- `scripts/process_training_feedback.py` - 7-step pipeline
- Quality scoring + distinction gap (0.15 min)
- Template cap: 10 user corrections per card
- Negative training via confusion matrix

### CLIP Model Configuration ✅
- Model: `ViT-B-32-quickgelu`
- Checkpoint: `laion2b_s34b_b79k` (LAION, not OpenAI)
- Cache: `/cache/open_clip` (persistent)
- Pre-download: Baked into Docker (~934MB)
- Result: No runtime download, instant startup

### Docker Optimization ✅
- Model download BEFORE code copy
- Deploy time: 16 min → 75 sec for code changes
- See: `docs/architecture/docker-layer-caching.md`

### Database Tables
- Phase 5a: `training_feedback` (29 rows logged)
- Phase 5b: `card_confusion` + `template_metadata` (new, empty)
- CRUD: `command_queue` (Optimistic Pipeline support)
- Soft delete: `deleted_at` column on `scans`

### Gallery/Embeddings
- 15,504 cards with prototypes
- 46,512+ templates (official)
- 0 user correction templates (ready for Phase 5b)
- Test accuracy: 100% on fixture set

## 📊 Latest Session Summary

**Built:** Phase 5b learning infrastructure (database + pipeline + docs)
**Fixed:** Worker CLIP model, UPSERT, view updates, delete functionality
**Optimized:** Docker layer caching (20x faster deploys)
**Documented:** System map, quick start, Docker best practices
**Merged:** Parallel session delete fix

## 🚀 What's Next (Next Session)

**Immediate:**
1. ⏳ Wait for Render deploy to complete
2. ✅ Test scan upload (verify worker works with LAION)
3. 🎯 Get users correcting cards
4. 🏭 Run Phase 5b processor
5. 📈 Watch accuracy climb

**This Week:**
- Automate Phase 5b (hourly cron or real-time)
- Build Phase 5c dashboard
- Add retry logic for CLIP (belt + suspenders)
- Test at scale (100+ corrections)

**This Month:**
- Export to marketplaces (monetization)
- Portfolio analytics
- Mobile optimization
- Marketing push (differentiate from Pokelenz)
