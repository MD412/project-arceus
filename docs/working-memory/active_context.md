# Active Context - Project Arceus

**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025 @ 2:00 AM  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 5a deployed & tested — Duplicate scan bug fixed, awaiting production validation

---

## 🎯 Current Status

**Session Focus:** Phase 5a deployed to production; duplicate upload bug discovered and fixed

### Latest Session (Oct 28, 2:00 AM)
- ✅ Deployed Phase 5a (migration + worker logging + correction API)
- ✅ Fixed duplicate logging bug in worker
- ✅ Discovered & fixed duplicate scan upload vulnerability
- ✅ Added unique constraint on storage_path + idempotent RPC
- ✅ Prevented frontend double-submission

**Ready for:**
- Production testing (upload scan to verify training_feedback logs)

## 🔴 Top Priorities

### 1. Validate Phase 5a in Production
- Upload test scan → Verify training_feedback rows created
- Correct a card → Verify corrected_card_id updated
- Test duplicate prevention (same file upload should reject)

### 2. Phase 5b — Auto-Learning (Next Feature)
- Background job to process pending corrections
- Auto-add high-confidence corrections as templates
- Rebuild prototypes incrementally

### 3. Template Bank Growth
- Add more clean scan crops as templates (focus on problematic cards)
- Light augmentation: photometric + blur (avoid heavy distortion)
- Rebuild prototypes incrementally

### 4. Production Monitoring
- Watch for UNKNOWN rate (too high = threshold too strict)
- Track wrong IDs (adjust threshold or add templates)
- Collect real-world accuracy metrics

## 🔧 Technical State
- Retrieval v2 live with `UNKNOWN_THRESHOLD=0.80` (calibrated for ≥99% precision)
- Gallery: 15,504 cards, 46,512+ templates (incl. clean scans)
- Test accuracy: 100% on fixture set (clear score separation)
- Domain gap fixed: clean scan templates provide exact matches (1.0 similarity)
- **Phase 5a deployed:** `training_feedback` table + worker logging + correction API + duplicate prevention
