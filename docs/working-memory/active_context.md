## 🔴 Top Priority: FIX MODAL CONFLICT

⚠️ **Critical Issue:** Modal CSS changes broke home page collection modal

The 2x2 grid layout for CorrectionModal is applied globally, breaking the collection modal.

**Recommended Fix:**
- Split Modal.tsx and CorrectionModal.tsx into separate components
- Each with their own CSS and layout logic
- Test both modals work correctly

**Ready to commit:**
- Scan detail page fixes
- Correction modal UX improvements  
- ML feedback loop documentation
- Git workflow improvements
