## 🔴 Priority

1. **Modal consistency** - User mentioned comparing home/scans modals but got tired before specifying fixes
2. **Check Render deploy** - Verify worker deploy success/failure
3. **Optional: Card size slider** - Re-enable with improvements (see `docs/future-features/card-size-slider.md`)

## 🚫 Deferred (Don't Touch Yet)

- ❌ Manual DevTools responsive testing
- ❌ Live worker validation  
- ❌ Trace ID propagation
- ❌ Search component consolidation
- ❌ Performance profiling
