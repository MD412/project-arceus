# Active Context - Project Arceus

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025 (10:50 PM)  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Status:** 🚀 Render deploy in progress (rotomi-worker)

---

## 🎯 Current Status

Render background worker is deploying (Hugging Face model loading wired). Next action depends on deploy outcome:

- If deploy SUCCEEDS: focus on UI regressions (sticky header/filters/table/grid, mobile).
- If deploy FAILS: continue worker deploy debugging (check Render logs; patch fast).
