Any time you run into supabase problems and can't find .env or .local.env it's because it's hidden from you in .gitignore . rest assured, I these keys are all correct and working.Whatever you're working on, this is not the problem. 


 no we're not running any local supabase link crap. we're working from the production db. in this context production is the test env cuz this is just a stealth solo side project no one cares or knows about yet lol
