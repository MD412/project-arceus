Rule 2: Session Context Priority

When user says "/start session" or begins a new conversation:

1. ALWAYS read `docs/working-memory/active_context.md` FIRST
   - This is the single source of truth for current status
   - It contains links to the most recent handoff and priorities
   
2. Follow the navigation from `active_context.md`:
   - Read the "Latest Handoff" link it provides
   - Check "Quick Links" section for other relevant docs
   - Trust the status and priorities stated there
   
3. For detailed next steps:
   - Read the latest handoff's "What's Next" section
   - Forward-looking action items are always in handoff files
   
4. If conflicting information exists:
   - `active_context.md` > latest handoff > older docs
   - Newest timestamp wins
   - Ask user to clarify if truly ambiguous
