When creating a new component:
- Check if related design tokens already exist in app/globals.css
- Reference global CSS variables in your component CSS modules
- Create a clean, reusable interface with appropriate props
- Document the component usage with examples
- Add the component to the design system library page

For design system implementation:
1. First, extract and implement foundational elements (colors, typography, spacing) from Figma to app/globals.css
2. Then build basic components using these variables
3. Finally, assemble more complex components from the basic building blocks

For design system library documentation:
- Each component should have its own section in the library
- Include a visual example of the component with variations
- Provide usage code snippets
- Document available props and their usage

- Group related components together (e.g., form elements, navigation)
