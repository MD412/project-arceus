# PowerShell Rules for AI Assistant

## Command Guidelines
- PowerShell uses `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl`
- Use `exit` to quit PowerShell, never `q`

## CRITICAL: Terminal Command Validation
**ALWAYS validate terminal commands before sending them**

### Common Error to PREVENT:
- ❌ `q^D^C` = "q: the term 'q' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program"
- ❌ Any command ending with stray characters like `q`, `^D`, `^C`

### Before using `run_terminal_cmd`:
1. Ensure command contains ONLY intended characters
2. No accidental Unix habits (like `q` to quit)
3. No control character artifacts (`^D`, `^C`)
4. Command is valid PowerShell syntax

### Examples:
- ✅ `git push`
- ❌ `git push q^D^C`
- ✅ `npm install`  
- ❌ `npm install q`
