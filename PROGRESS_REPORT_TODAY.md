# Project Arceus - Daily Progress Report

**Date**: Today  
**Developer**: [Your Name]  
**For**: PM

## Executive Summary

Today's development focused on critical UI/UX improvements and architectural fixes that enhance the user experience and set the foundation for the scan-to-collection workflow. While these weren't explicitly outlined in the 3x3 vision document, they are essential prerequisites for the "Review UI" component mentioned in the pipeline.

## Features Implemented Today

### 1. Fixed Yellow Border Focus Bug ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Trading cards were getting stuck with yellow borders when navigating between pages  
**Solution**: 
- Changed `:focus` to `:focus-visible` for keyboard-only focus indication
- Added `blur()` on click events to prevent focus persistence
- **Impact**: Cleaner visual experience, no more distracting stuck states

### 2. Modal System Implementation ‚úÖ
**What**: Built a full-featured modal component system  
**Features**:
- ESC key handling
- Body scroll lock when open
- Backdrop click to close
- Specialized `CardInfoModal` with large display area (1200px √ó 90vh)
- Split layout: image left, details right
- Mobile responsive
- Smooth animations
**Impact**: Essential for the "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" functionality in the Review UI mentioned in the 3x3 vision

### 3. Sidebar Minimize/Expand Feature ‚úÖ
**What**: Added collapsible sidebar navigation  
**Implementation**:
- Floating toggle button attached to top toolbar
- Persistent state via localStorage
- Smooth transitions
- Icons change based on state (PanelLeft/PanelLeftClose)
- Mobile hidden
**Iterations**: Went through multiple design iterations based on UX feedback
**Impact**: Better screen real estate for reviewing card grids

### 4. CSS Architecture Fix ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Minimized sidebar icons were cramped against the left edge  
**Root Cause**: Parent container padding wasn't being overridden when minimized  
**Solution**: Added proper CSS cascade override for `.sidebar-nav` padding
**Impact**: Proper icon centering and visual hierarchy

### 5. Code Cleanup ‚úÖ
**What**: Removed redundant minimize button from sidebar bottom
**Result**: Cleaner, single-source-of-truth for minimize functionality

## Alignment with 3x3 Vision

| Vision Component | Today's Progress | Status |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| **Review UI** | Modal system provides foundation for "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" functionality | üü° Partial |
| **FE 3√ó3 Grid** | UI improvements prepare for better grid display | üü° Enabling |
| **User Experience** | Sidebar minimize gives more space for card grid review | ‚úÖ Direct |
| **Card Details View** | Modal system ready for enriched card data display | ‚úÖ Direct |

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Modal as Separate Component**: Built reusable modal system rather than inline implementations
2. **CSS Architecture First**: Fixed structural CSS issues before adding features
3. **localStorage for State**: Simple persistence without backend complexity
4. **Focus Management**: Proper accessibility considerations for keyboard users

## Next Immediate Steps (Recommended Priority)

### 1. User Cards Database (Recommended Next)
- Create `user_cards` table
- Link cards to users with proper ownership chain
- Track source (manual vs scan)
- Enable collection management

### 2. Connect Scan Workflow
- When scan completes ‚Üí create user_cards entries
- Handle the scan ‚Üí detected_cards ‚Üí user_cards flow
- Implement confirmation UI using today's modal system

### 3. Collection Management UI
- Leverage today's modal for card editing
- Use improved layout space from sidebar minimize
- Implement grid view with today's UI improvements

## Metrics

- **Components Added**: 2 (Modal, CardInfoModal)
- **Bug Fixes**: 2 (Yellow border, Icon spacing)
- **Features**: 2 (Modal system, Sidebar minimize)
- **Lines of Code**: ~500 (CSS + TSX)
- **User-Facing Improvements**: 4

## Blockers/Concerns

None currently. Ready to proceed with database implementation.

## Summary

While today's work wasn't explicitly listed in the 3x3 vision pipeline, it provides critical infrastructure for the "Review UI" component. The modal system directly enables the edit functionality, the sidebar improvements give more space for the 3√ó3 grid display, and the CSS fixes ensure a professional user experience. We're now well-positioned to implement the database layer and connect the scan workflow to user collections.
